          "comment": "A new decade and new year starts tomorrow! ü•≥üéä This year was a whirlwind for me. Focusing on the positives, here are a few stand out takeaways... It was the year that I quit my full-time job and threw myself into the freelance life. It was the year that I made the most incredible friendships. It was the year that my family grew stronger. It was the year that I went to a dozen new places that I‚Äôve never been before. It was the year I learnt the most about myself!\n-\nSome details about the photos in this post:\n1. I was on a trip to the Dolomites with @mikesugianto and we ended up in Austria for less than 72 hours (we probably only slept like 10 hours total in 3 days).\n2. I went to Patagonia for the first time. It was a trip with 7 pals‚Äîso hectic but so fun.\n3. I explored Yosemite with @thismattexsits which kind of felt like a right of passage in some ways. So iconic.\n4. I booked a last minute flight to the east coast of the US to chase fall colours with an epic squad of old and new friends. It was a fun-filled 5 days that‚Äôs for sure.\n5. I went to Italy and fell in love with the country (like everyone does)\n6. @mikesugianto and I also went to Iceland. It‚Äôs a country that is so diverse that 10 days wasn‚Äôt even a fraction of enough time to explore it.\n7. I went to Hawaii with a great squad. It rained 90% of the time but we still walked away with great memories and a few good photos.\n8. For the first trip of my new freelance career, I went to Idaho on a winter hot spring road trip. It was SO much fun and definietly recommend road trips like these. \n9. I explored Washington many, many, many times because I just can‚Äôt get enough of that state! So much hiking to do there.\n10. Last but not least, I stayed home in beautiful British Columbia a lot because of this little thing called‚Ä¶ HOME LOVE!\n-\nI hope you have a wonderful and safe New Years Eve and have an even better 2020. Thank you for following along on my adventure. Without your support, I wouldn‚Äôt be here‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è\n-\nPhotographers/pals/talented humans who helped me are tagged in the photos",

          "comment": "A new decade and new year starts tomorrow! ü•≥üéä This year was a whirlwind for me. Focusing on the positives, here are a few stand out takeaways... It was the year that I quit my full-time job and threw myself into the freelance life. It was the year that I made the most incredible friendships. It was the year that my family grew stronger. It was the year that I went to a dozen new places that I‚Äôve never been before. It was the year I learnt the most about myself!\n-\nSome details about the photos in this post:\n1. I was on a trip to the Dolomites with @mikesugianto and we ended up in Austria for less than 72 hours (we probably only slept like 10 hours total in 3 days).\n2. I went to Patagonia for the first time. It was a trip with 7 pals‚Äîso hectic but so fun.\n3. I explored Yosemite with @thismattexsits which kind of felt like a right of passage in some ways. So iconic.\n4. I booked a last minute flight to the east coast of the US to chase fall colours with an epic squad of old and new friends. It was a fun-filled 5 days that‚Äôs for sure.\n5. I went to Italy and fell in love with the country (like everyone does)\n6. @mikesugianto and I also went to Iceland. It‚Äôs a country that is so diverse that 10 days wasn‚Äôt even a fraction of enough time to explore it.\n7. I went to Hawaii with a great squad. It rained 90% of the time but we still walked away with great memories and a few good photos.\n8. For the first trip of my new freelance career, I went to Idaho on a winter hot spring road trip. It was SO much fun and definietly recommend road trips like these. \n9. I explored Washington many, many, many times because I just can‚Äôt get enough of that state! So much hiking to do there.\n10. Last but not least, I stayed home in beautiful British Columbia a lot because of this little thing called‚Ä¶ HOME LOVE!\n-\nI hope you have a wonderful and safe New Years Eve and have an even better 2020. Thank you for following along on my adventure. Without your support, I wouldn‚Äôt be here‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è\n-\nPhotographers/pals/talented humans who helped me are tagged in the photos",

Some might say that this is my golden birthday and when I look forward at the big things I have planned for this coming year I can help but think that‚Äôs true.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nLooking back at this last year I feel an assortment of emotions. I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the amount of abundance I attracted into my life... I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the good friends that became best friends and all the new friends I‚Äôve met... Getting engaged to the man of my dreams.... Paying off all my debt... gratitude for all of you and your continued support.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBut I also look back and see the biggest internal struggles I‚Äôve faced yet... the heartbreak of my autoimmune diagnosis... the feelings of confusion... feeling lost in a life that‚Äôs quite different than I imagined and, a lot of the time, feeling at mercy to the numbers on a screen.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI‚Äôve heard it said by many from my older friends and mentors that your 20s are where you find yourself and your 30s are so amazing because you are so much more settled in who you are.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAs I look forward to this final year of my 20s I feel ready to make some much needed changes. I feel ready to step more fully into myself and trust that when I follow my heart my choices not only serve me, but also the greatest good of all. I‚Äôm ready to be the fullest version of myself even if it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for some people out there. I‚Äôm ready to do the work that it takes so that next year, as I arrive to my next decade of life, I feel just a little more certain about what it means to be me.",

          "comment": "This may surprise you but it‚Äôs rare that I am naturally good at things when I get started. I feel like we live in such an instant gratification world sometimes that it‚Äôs easy to assume everyone who we know that‚Äôs good at something was simply ‚Äúa natural‚Äù.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThink about this: this is my 2,000th post here on Instagram... I have posted consistently here on this platform almost every day for the last 4.5 years now... there are sooo many people with a similar amount of followers as me who have posted wayyyyy less photos than I have. I was not an overnight success here on Instagram... but I continued to show up. Day after day. Month after month. Year after year. I stayed consistent.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI also didn‚Äôt start out very good at riding park on my snowboard.... or even being very good at snowboarding in general. My nickname in High School was ‚Äúwack style girl‚Äù because my riding style justified it... but I kept training... I kept trying... I kept falling... and now... after 18 years of snowboarding I feel pretty damn confident out there...\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI could tell you a similar story for my yoga practice or teaching journey... my online health business... my photography and editing skills... I feel so grateful for levels of success I‚Äôve been able to reach in multiple aspects of my life but I know the truth... I get to celebrate because I didn‚Äôt give up when it got hard... or when I got bored... or when it seemed like I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgetting anywhere with it‚Äù. I just continued to show up.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBecause of this instant gratification world we live in I think people overestimate what they might be capable of in the short run and if they don‚Äôt hit their goals so many people just give up... and move on to the next goal. But I also think that people seriously underestimate what‚Äôs possible over the long-run if they were to just stay consistent.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo cheers to post number 2,000 and cheers to 2,000 more. Cheers to falling and failing and get back up again. Cheers to continuing to make steps when it feels hard or when everyone else doubts me. Cheers the magic that‚Äôs possible when you don‚Äôt give up.",

          "comment": "2019 has been my biggest travel year to date. Between teaching at yoga festivals/trainings, work trips for either of my businesses, and a few personal trips I had four separate international trips and literally too many domestic flights to even count.¬†¬†It seemed like every month I was away more than I was home. While I am super grateful for all the new experiences I had and all the amazing people I met along the way my heart is definitely craving some Colorado time.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFor the month of January, I plan to stay rooted here in my home state. While I plan to be home on the weekdays, pretty much every weekend in January I have something fun planned: taking a yoga workshop with my teacher, doing my Wilderness First Aid cert, speaking at a regional event for my health business which will take me to Denver, Boulder and Steamboat Springs‚Ä¶ all within a four-hour drive of my home in Aspen!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI feel like I‚Äôve got my travel kit pretty much dialed these days. My two go-to bags are the @backcountry All Around 60L Duffel and the 27L Daypack. The duffel is a new addition to my travel kit and it‚Äôs perfect for a long weekend trip in the winter because it has plenty of space for all the layers I need for Colorado winter weather/adventures. It‚Äôs also super durable so it does well being constantly thrown around. The @backcountry Daypack has been my travel backpack of choice since I got it in the spring because it seems to work perfectly whether it‚Äôs carrying my laptop and technology on the plane OR my camelback, layers, and snack on the trail.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI think sometimes we over glorify big trips where we have to fly far away and forget that hopping in the car for a short adventure can be just as magical and exciting. If you need to re-up on any of your travel gear feel free to use the code ‚ÄúARIELLE15‚Äù for 15% off *some exclusions apply*\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\np.s. since I know you are going to ask, the fleece I‚Äôm wearing is called the @backcountry Sherpa Fleece Jacket and I‚Äôm totally obsessed. #findyourbackcountry #backcountrypartner",

If you‚Äôve been following me for a while then you know I‚Äôve been working with @YoColorado for at least 3 years now and it makes me so proud to represent this local Colorado company.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSomething you may not know is our history. 3.5 years ago, I got an email from one of the @yocolorado owners asking for my mailing address and about a week later I went to my PO Box to discover a box of goodies. At the time I had less than 10k followers and was only posting GoPro selfies‚Ä¶ this was long before any professional looking photos were happening. Their box was the first thing I‚Äôd ever received on my Instagram journey. Each season, without fail, I‚Äôd open my PO box and find another surprise box full of hats, socks and apparel.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI finally got to meet the owners of this awesome company this spring and they were just as kind as I imagined. It meant so much to me to finally put the faces behind this super cool Colorado company that had shown me support from the very beginning.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nWhether it‚Äôs the socks, a beanie or some apparel (like this cool vest I‚Äôm wearing) you can usually find me wearing at least one piece of @YoColorado gear. I love how many people I meet ask me where I got my gear‚Ä¶ I love getting to send new people over to @YoColorado and supporting these amazing humans who have shown me so much support over the years. If you have some Yo Colorado gear on your personal gift list year feel free to use the code YoArielle and #treatyoself with 20% off!¬†¬†#yocoloradopartner (photo by @photograferg )",

          "comment": "As I write this my pup, Tabor, is cuddled up next to me on the couch. It‚Äôs so wild to think that this dog who was scared of everything and everyone is now such a brave adventurer and excellent cuddle buddy‚Ä¶\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIt‚Äôs been a little over a year now since we rescued her and even though we were told she was saved from a puppy mill we know relatively little about her background or the breeding practices of the place she was rescued from.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIn Oct I partnered with @wisdompanel to celebrate Adopt a Shelter Dog month and as part of that partnership, we got to test out the #WisdomPanel 4.0 for ourselves and find out a bit more about Tabor‚Äôs genetic story.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAccording to her results, she is 75% Mini American Shepherd (also known as mini Aussie) and 25% Australian Shepherd but the most impactful thing we learned was that she is positive for the MDR1 gene mutation! Dogs that have the MDR1 mutation may potentially have harmful reactions to commonly used medications, so informing Tabor‚Äôs veterinarian about this information is really important. They can identify appropriate medications to use that will not have these side effects so we‚Äôre able to keep Tabor safe and healthy.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAdopting from a shelter is INCREDIBLY rewarding but not knowing your dog‚Äôs history can feel a bit disempowering. Learning more about Tabor‚Äôs genetics has made me feel like I have more tools than ever to be the dog mama she deserves and I‚Äôm looking forward to as many years of adventures together as possible!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIf you are curious about learning more about your dog‚Äôs genetics check out @wisdompanel!

The place that I‚Äôm sitting in this photo now likely covered in a couple of feet of snow (it‚Äôs crazy how fast things can transition here in the mountains!) but when the road is open this is just a simple 15-min drive from my house. There are a lot of challenges when it comes to living in a small (and very expensive) mountain town but when I look around and see how beautiful it is none of those things matter to me. I just can‚Äôt help but be extremely grateful.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nLast month @eddiebauer hosted its creator summit here in Aspen and I got the chance to show off my beautiful backyard to a bunch of amazing creators. Not being a photographer myself it was so cool to me to see how they told the story of Aspen through their photos and it was fun for me to see this town I grew up in through new eyes.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThe weather this fall has been a bit crazy so even though this was taken weeks before the mountains opened we already had A TON of snow and I was so grateful for all the @eddiebauer gear I got to test out. I‚Äôve found that everything they make is super functional but they have such a great range of styled pieces to super technical piece. Even though this was a very ‚Äútown ready‚Äù outfit it was still super warm and the awesome tread on the shoes made navigating the icy conditions super easy.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIf you want the full breakdown of what I‚Äôm wearing pop over to my stories for all the details. I want to send a massive thanks to @michaelmatti for snapping these awesome photos (it was great to finally meet you in person!) and I‚Äôm curious, for all of you out there- What do you love most about where you live? #EBcontributer #liveyouradventure",

          "comment": "Today I was up way before the sun. I‚Äôm going on my first hut trip today and I think excitement has gotten the best of me. Even though I grew up here in Colorado, my focus was on riding park so the whole idea of adventure skiing/snowboarding is new to me.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThis will be my split board‚Äôs first adventure off the resort and my first time skinning up something that wasn‚Äôt recently groomed... I don‚Äôt know if any of you can relate but I‚Äôve wanted to get into the backcountry for awhile now but I just didn‚Äôt know where to start.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFinally, this year I just pulled the trigger... I stopped waiting for something to happen and made it happen! This hut trip is guided and also an avalanche course so I can get some real hands on experience with some people who REALLY know their stuff.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nOne of the biggest things I‚Äôve learned over the last few years is in order to achieve my goals I have to be comfortable being uncomfortable... I have to be ok with not having it all figured out and starting anyways. I have to ask the right questions... seek out the right people... and be willing to invest in myself and my future.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo maybe this is just a 3-day hut trip... or maybe this is the gateway into the next chapter of my life. Either way, I‚Äôm excited for the adventure.",

I can have something happen where nearly everything is positive and exciting but afterwards I end up spinning on the 1-2 things that were slightly off.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nNow I‚Äôm not here to condone holding in negative emotions (I don‚Äôt think shoving things down ever served ANYONE in the long run) but I am personally trying to shift the focus...\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo a few things didn‚Äôt go as planned... why not celebrate all the amazing things that did? Or celebrate the things that even went better than planned?

Today I‚Äôm choosing gratitude. Over. And over. And over again. Until gratitude is the habit and complaining is a distant memory. Who‚Äôs with me?",

          "comment": "I‚Äôve heard it said before that those who find themselves living in the past often experience feelings of depression and those who live in the future are often overwhelmed with feelings of anxiety and that the path to freedom is learning to live in the present moment.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI don‚Äôt know about you but I find myself regularly caught up in the ‚Äúif, then‚Äù cycle. If I I achieve this goal, then I‚Äôll be happy... often leaving the joys of life as some distant future thing that I have to qualify for.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFor example, the pose in this picture... I used to dream of the day that my body could make this shape. I believed that by being able to do a pose like this I would  be considered a more credible teacher. So I worked and worked and when the day came that I actually was able to make this shape do you know where my mind immediately went? To the next goal. ‚ÄúWell this is nice and all but I‚Äôll REALLY be credible when I can get my top leg straight.‚Äù\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBecause of my ‚Äúif, then‚Äù mentality I tend to hit a lot of my goals but often at the sake of the enjoyment of life. I get so caught up in what‚Äôs next that I often forget to feel the magic of the journey itself.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nHere‚Äôs the thing, working on this pose actually did make me a better teacher... but it wasn‚Äôt the achieving of the pose that did. I spent hours on the mat in the process of learning this shape... because of that I gained incredible insights into the anatomy/biomechanics of the shoulders and the interplay of the hips, spine and lateral body. I also learned a lot about discomfort and what I‚Äôm capable of.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nYou‚Äôve heard me talk a lot lately about bringing more joy and lightheartedness into my life and the root of that for me is learning to be more in the present moment. Learning that even if I have goals for the future there‚Äôs no need to give up the joys along the way because in the end there will always be another pose to learn... another mountain to climb... another thing to cross of the list and, in the end, it‚Äôs journey there that matters most. It‚Äôs the ever unfolding present moments stacked on top of one another. It‚Äôs now. And now. And now. And NOW. (Photo by @alexisahrling)",

I swear I could write a caption where I pour my heart out but if I‚Äôm wearing these bad boys I‚Äôll get WAY more comments about my boots than about anything I wrote lol\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIt‚Äôs ok, I don‚Äôt blame you. They are pretty cute. These boots are called the Everson from @bionicashoes and I‚Äôve ended up wearing them almost every day since I got them. They have become my go-to‚Äôs for a few reasons:\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFirst is their functionality (of course). They are fully waterproof and have great tread which is ESSENTIAL if you are living in the mountains in the winter! Second is the style. They go well with pretty much anything‚Ä¶ from what I wear to yoga to what I wear out to dinner... casual or a little dressier. And lastly, the convenience/comfort. They are the comfiest booties I own AND they have a zipper on the inside so they are SUPER easy to take on and off. This may seem like a small thing but when I‚Äôm running out the door quickly (which is most of the time) I always end up choosing what‚Äôs easy.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI know the holidays are coming up quick so if you are looking for a great gift idea or maybe a little gift to yourself feel free to use the code ‚Äúarielle20‚Äù for 20% your entire @bionicashoes order. I love how many of you have sent me pics of your ‚ÄúArielle Inspired‚Äù gear/outfits. Are any of you going to be twinning with me? (photo by @photograferg) #bionicaventures #bionicapartner",

          "comment": "Truth be told I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of confusion lately. This whole Instagram thing was never part of my plan and sometimes I feel like I have no idea what I‚Äôm even doing.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBefore Instagram became a thing for me I was a full-time yoga teacher. I taught about a million and a half classes a week to afford to live in Aspen and was constantly pushing up against burnout but I was sure of myself... I knew who I was and had a deep sense of purpose in the work I was doing.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFlash forward to today... I‚Äôm still working hard but it looks so different now. I have a lot more free time and freedom... money isn‚Äôt so tight. I have the freedom to chase big dreams like my PCT hike next year... but I also have so much confusion about my contribution to the world.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI share all this because I think it‚Äôs easy to look at the people we follow online and think their lives are perfect.. or they have it all figured out... I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else but I definitely know that I am still ‚Äúfiguring all this out‚Äù.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI‚Äôm learning how to take all of this unexpectedness and turn it into meaning. I‚Äôm learning how to find my own way in a world that wants to push you one way or the other. I‚Äôm learning how to find my voice and speak my truths.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI have no idea what this next year will look like but I have a feeling we are all in for more surprises. Even though all this was never a part of the plan I‚Äôm so grateful... I‚Äôm grateful for each and every one of you... and I‚Äôm grateful we get to explore all this madness together.

It‚Äôs made it easy for me to check in on her activity levels and see when I‚Äôm slacking as her caretaker. It‚Äôs been helping me be the dog mom she deserves!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIf you are anything like me and there are still a few people left to buy gifts for this holiday season (I know, I know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm slacking) than I highly recommend they GO Explore from @whistlelabs for any dog parents in your life (you can use the code ARIELLE for 30% off). It has brought me so much peace of mind over the last few months and I swear it‚Äôs training me to have the best habits possible when it comes to taking care of Miss Tabor. #PetsLoveWhistle #whistlelabspartner",

Honestly... some fear and respect for the backcountry.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nOne of my last years living in Tahoe I did an AVI course but it was such a bad drought year that even in the of January we barely had enough snow to do the practical portions of the course so we focused more on in-class work.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThe course leaders had us read many heart breaking stories of the consequences of poor judgement or small mistakes... and having lived in mountain towns most of my life... I‚Äôve unfortunately known many people whose lives ended in unexpected slides.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nWhile I think fear is ultimately a good thing... it points us in the direction of making better decisions... I don‚Äôt think being immobilized by it serves growth in any way and I‚Äôm ready to face some fears.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI just signed up for another AVI 1 course that is run as a three day hut trip. It will be my first hut trip ever and, with all the snow we already have, I am excited to get some more hands on experience out there.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI have a big goal this coming year of getting more and more comfortable out in the wilderness... learning the skills I need to make smart decisions out there. Anyone else facing some fears this winter?\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nPhoto by @photograferg",

So by entering you are not just gifting, you‚Äôre giving! I love this concept for many reasons but seeing as though the holiday season can be one of the loneliest times of the year for so many and I love the idea of people using modern technology to make new friendships and real connections! #bumblegiveguide #bumblepartner",

          "comment": "When I was 17 years old I got my first tattoo. I gathered up enough strength to walk up to the tattoo place, hand the artist my ID clearly saying I wasn‚Äôt 18 yet and ask for a tattoo of the word ‚Äúfearless‚Äù on the inside of my middle finger. Truth be told I think I had so much conviction that the artist didn‚Äôt even question my age enough to look at the ID. He just made a photocopy and took me back to the chair.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI laugh a bit about this now because nearly 12 years later I know that the fearlessness I was searching for doesn‚Äôt actually exist. At the time I was searching for a reminder when I wanted to hit a big jump on my snowboard that I was going to be ok... that I ‚Äúhad it‚Äù... and being fearless seemed like the solution....\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned though, fear isn‚Äôt the problem and it isn‚Äôt going anywhere. While I‚Äôll likely never hit a big jump on my board ever again the fear comes up in other places... letting go of a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù career to follow my heart... public speaking... pouring my heart into words and putting it out there for the world to see and judge... making big scary steps towards goals with the total possibility of failing...\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSometimes our fears protect us... physiologically they‚Äôre designed to keep us alive. But more often than not these fears bubble up and we give them so much power that we stay small... and we play small with our lives...\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI wish I could tell you that becoming fearless is the answer... I really do. But in reality I think what we are looking for when we seek to be fearless is actually strength... it‚Äôs courage. In a momentary boost of courage we can make a small decision that changes the whole trajectory of our lives... even if it‚Äôs just to prove to ourselves, for once, we are stronger then we think we are.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo cheers to being brave. Cheers to looking at that ‚Äúthing‚Äù whatever it is and taking a big breath and saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this‚Äù. Cheers to fear... and cheers to courage.",

One way to start that resolution is to book some ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù trips where the sole purpose is just to play, explore and disconnect. For as long as I‚Äôve been booking my own travel, I‚Äôve used @bookingcom. For me, it‚Äôs always been the best way to compare options and take the stress out of the planning part of travel.

I‚Äôve always found that if I stop for a full lunch in the middle of the day it‚Äôs game over‚Ä¶ lack of motivation creeps up on me and I end up calling it a day.¬†For as long as I can remember my strategy has been to have as late of a breakfast as I could manage, grab a bar to keep my energy up, and then eat a full lunch when I get home around 2-3 pm.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBars are the best solution because they are easy to stash in my pocket and eat on the lift (or at the top if I‚Äôm hiking up) but it can be really hard to find ones that have good ingredients AND actually taste good. My favorite bars (hands down) are @GoMacro and they have been for the last few years now. Being a chocoholic, I love any flavor with chocolate chips in it but this new ‚Äúsweet awakening‚Äù mocha chocolate chip flavor has been REALLY hitting the spot lately.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI love that @GoMacro bars are all¬†certified¬†organic,¬†vegan,¬†and gluten-free. When I look at the ingredients I know what everything is! If you‚Äôve been following me for a while you know how important that last part is to me! To all my adventure friends out there, have you tried @GoMacro yet? What are your favorite flavors? #GoMarco #biggerthanabar",

          "comment": "One of my goals from 2019 that I plan to carry into 2020 is to use less single-use plastic. It‚Äôs honestly harder than it should be to avoid because it basically eliminates half of the grocery store while shopping and even really simple things come wrapped in plastic for no reason.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nWhile avoiding single-use plastics while grocery shopping can definitely be a challenge there are some really simple changes that you can make that actually make a HUGE difference. The biggest one? Stop using single-use plastic water bottles. While I have been using a reusable water bottle for many years now the one place I still found this to be tricky is traveling (especially to places who don‚Äôt have clean drinking water on tap).\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThat is one of the reasons I love the @lifestraw GO Water bottle. @lifestraw‚Äôs technology filters out up to at least 99% of waterborne bacteria and contaminants making it the perfect travel companion. I love that I can drink safely from sinks in developing countries as well as lakes and streams when I‚Äôm out hiking.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI also LOVE that for every product purchased @lifestraw provides clean drinking water for a year to a child in need! So not only is purchasing a LifeStraw Go Water bottle go for the planet as a whole it makes a HUGE impact in the life of someone in need. For more info on @lifestraw products and mission check out my stories or head over to their website!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAnyone else adding ‚Äúusing less single-use plastics‚Äù to their New Year‚Äôs resolution list? #lifestraw #sponsored",

          "comment": "#ad Earlier this week I was having a conversation with my little sister about how to make better decisions at the grocery store. She is a senior in high school and getting excited to head off to college next fall but realizing that for the first time in her life she will be in charge of choosing what she eats. I told her not to worry about perfection, to enjoy college, and enjoy her freedom, but when she is choosing things from the store to always look at the ingredient labels and ask herself, ‚ÄúCan I pronounce all these words?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre these REAL ingredients?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs what I‚Äôm holding made with actual food?‚Äù\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nYou would think while food shopping this would be a given but it‚Äôs actually pretty crazy the things that end up in our favorite ‚Äúfoods‚Äù when we actually stop to look. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I am a big fan of @kettlebrand chips. Especially flavors like organic salt and fresh ground pepper which are not only packed with flavor but real organic ingredients like sea salt, organic black pepper, and organic jalape√±o powder. No artificial preservatives. No GMO ingredients. No gluten. Just real food.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nGreta, if you are reading this and you are anything like me, chips may become a staple food of your freshman year‚Ä¶ something about chips and college really goes together lol Remember to read the ingredients and choose chips like @kettlebrand chips. For those of you who are not Greta, what Kettle Chips flavors do you recommend for her? #kettlebrand #liveflavorfully",

Honestly... some fear and respect for the backcountry.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nOne of my last years living in Tahoe I did an AVI course but it was such a bad drought year that even in the of January we barely had enough snow to do the practical portions of the course so we focused more on in-class work.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThe course leaders had us read many heart breaking stories of the consequences of poor judgement or small mistakes... and having lived in mountain towns most of my life... I‚Äôve unfortunately known many people whose lives ended in unexpected slides.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nWhile I think fear is ultimately a good thing... it points us in the direction of making better decisions... I don‚Äôt think being immobilized by it serves growth in any way and I‚Äôm ready to face some fears.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI just signed up for another AVI 1 course that is run as a three day hut trip. It will be my first hut trip ever and, with all the snow we already have, I am excited to get some more hands on experience out there.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI have a big goal this coming year of getting more and more comfortable out in the wilderness... learning the skills I need to make smart decisions out there.

If you‚Äôve been following me for a while then you know I‚Äôve been working with @YoColorado for at least 3 years now and it makes me so proud to represent this local Colorado company.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSomething you may not know is our history. 3.5 years ago, I got an email from one of the @yocolorado owners asking for my mailing address and about a week later I went to my PO Box to discover a box of goodies. At the time I had less than 10k followers and was only posting GoPro selfies‚Ä¶ this was long before any professional looking photos were happening. Their box was the first thing I‚Äôd ever received on my Instagram journey. Each season, without fail, I‚Äôd open my PO box and find another surprise box full of hats, socks and apparel.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI finally got to meet the owners of this awesome company this spring and they were just as kind as I imagined. It meant so much to me to finally put the faces behind this super cool Colorado company that had shown me support from the very beginning.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nWhether it‚Äôs the socks, a beanie or some apparel (like this cool vest I‚Äôm wearing) you can usually find me wearing at least one piece of @YoColorado gear. I love how many people I meet ask me where I got my gear‚Ä¶ I love getting to send new people over to @YoColorado and supporting these amazing humans who have shown me so much support over the years. If you have some Yo Colorado gear on your personal gift list year feel free to use the code YoArielle and #treatyoself with 20% off!¬†¬†#yocoloradopartner (photo by @photograferg )",

          "comment": "This may surprise you but it‚Äôs rare that I am naturally good at things when I get started. I feel like we live in such an instant gratification world sometimes that it‚Äôs easy to assume everyone who we know that‚Äôs good at something was simply ‚Äúa natural‚Äù.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThink about this: this is my 2,000th post here on Instagram... I have posted consistently here on this platform almost every day for the last 4.5 years now... there are sooo many people with a similar amount of followers as me who have posted wayyyyy less photos than I have. I was not an overnight success here on Instagram... but I continued to show up. Day after day. Month after month. Year after year. I stayed consistent.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI also didn‚Äôt start out very good at riding park on my snowboard.... or even being very good at snowboarding in general. My nickname in High School was ‚Äúwack style girl‚Äù because my riding style justified it... but I kept training... I kept trying... I kept falling... and now... after 18 years of snowboarding I feel pretty damn confident out there...\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI could tell you a similar story for my yoga practice or teaching journey... my online health business... my photography and editing skills... I feel so grateful for levels of success I‚Äôve been able to reach in multiple aspects of my life but I know the truth... I get to celebrate because I didn‚Äôt give up when it got hard... or when I got bored... or when it seemed like I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgetting anywhere with it‚Äù. I just continued to show up.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBecause of this instant gratification world we live in I think people overestimate what they might be capable of in the short run and if they don‚Äôt hit their goals so many people just give up... and move on to the next goal. But I also think that people seriously underestimate what‚Äôs possible over the long-run if they were to just stay consistent.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo cheers to post number 2,000 and cheers to 2,000 more. Cheers to falling and failing and get back up again. Cheers to continuing to make steps when it feels hard or when everyone else doubts me. Cheers the magic that‚Äôs possible when you don‚Äôt give up.",

          "comment": "As I write this my pup, Tabor, is cuddled up next to me on the couch. It‚Äôs so wild to think that this dog who was scared of everything and everyone is now such a brave adventurer and excellent cuddle buddy‚Ä¶\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIt‚Äôs been a little over a year now since we rescued her and even though we were told she was saved from a puppy mill we know relatively little about her background or the breeding practices of the place she was rescued from.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIn Oct I partnered with @wisdompanel to celebrate Adopt a Shelter Dog month and as part of that partnership, we got to test out the #WisdomPanel 4.0 for ourselves and find out a bit more about Tabor‚Äôs genetic story.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAccording to her results, she is 75% Mini American Shepherd (also known as mini Aussie) and 25% Australian Shepherd but the most impactful thing we learned was that she is positive for the MDR1 gene mutation! Dogs that have the MDR1 mutation may potentially have harmful reactions to commonly used medications, so informing Tabor‚Äôs veterinarian about this information is really important. They can identify appropriate medications to use that will not have these side effects so we‚Äôre able to keep Tabor safe and healthy.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAdopting from a shelter is INCREDIBLY rewarding but not knowing your dog‚Äôs history can feel a bit disempowering. Learning more about Tabor‚Äôs genetics has made me feel like I have more tools than ever to be the dog mama she deserves and I‚Äôm looking forward to as many years of adventures together as possible!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIf you are curious about learning more about your dog‚Äôs genetics check out @wisdompanel! For the holidays, use the code HOLIDAYS2019 for $20 off 4.0/Health products. And for those of you who have run your dog‚Äôs genetics before, what surprises did you have?? #WisdomPanelPartner #givethegiftofwisdom",

          "comment": "Truth be told I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of confusion lately. This whole Instagram thing was never part of my plan and sometimes I feel like I have no idea what I‚Äôm even doing.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBefore Instagram became a thing for me I was a full-time yoga teacher. I taught about a million and a half classes a week to afford to live in Aspen and was constantly pushing up against burnout but I was sure of myself... I knew who I was and had a deep sense of purpose in the work I was doing.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFlash forward to today... I‚Äôm still working hard but it looks so different now. I have a lot more free time and freedom... money isn‚Äôt so tight. I have the freedom to chase big dreams like my PCT hike next year... but I also have so much confusion about my contribution to the world.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI share all this because I think it‚Äôs easy to look at the people we follow online and think their lives are perfect.. or they have it all figured out... I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else but I definitely know that I am still ‚Äúfiguring all this out‚Äù.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI‚Äôm learning how to take all of this unexpectedness and turn it into meaning. I‚Äôm learning how to find my own way in a world that wants to push you one way or the other. I‚Äôm learning how to find my voice and speak my truths.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI have no idea what this next year will look like but I have a feeling we are all in for more surprises. Even though all this was never a part of the plan I‚Äôm so grateful... I‚Äôm grateful for each and every one of you... and I‚Äôm grateful we get to explore all this madness together.

          "comment": "#ad Earlier this week I was having a conversation with my little sister about how to make better decisions at the grocery store. She is a senior in high school and getting excited to head off to college next fall but realizing that for the first time in her life she will be in charge of choosing what she eats. I told her not to worry about perfection, to enjoy college, and enjoy her freedom, but when she is choosing things from the store to always look at the ingredient labels and ask herself, ‚ÄúCan I pronounce all these words?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre these REAL ingredients?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs what I‚Äôm holding made with actual food?‚Äù\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nYou would think while food shopping this would be a given but it‚Äôs actually pretty crazy the things that end up in our favorite ‚Äúfoods‚Äù when we actually stop to look. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I am a big fan of @kettlebrand chips. Especially flavors like organic salt and fresh ground pepper which are not only packed with flavor but real organic ingredients like sea salt, organic black pepper, and organic jalape√±o powder. No artificial preservatives. No GMO ingredients. No gluten. Just real food.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nGreta, if you are reading this and you are anything like me, chips may become a staple food of your freshman year‚Ä¶ something about chips and college really goes together lol Remember to read the ingredients and choose chips like @kettlebrand chips. For those of you who are not Greta, what Kettle Chips flavors do you recommend for her? #kettlebrand #liveflavorfully",

          "comment": "I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever gotten more ‚ÄúWhere are your boots from?‚Äù comments or DMs about any other pair of shoes before. I swear I could write a caption where I pour my heart out but if I‚Äôm wearing these bad boys I‚Äôll get WAY more comments about my boots than about anything I wrote lol\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIt‚Äôs ok, I don‚Äôt blame you. They are pretty cute. These boots are called the Everson from @bionicashoes and I‚Äôve ended up wearing them almost every day since I got them. They have become my go-to‚Äôs for a few reasons:\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFirst is their functionality (of course). They are fully waterproof and have great tread which is ESSENTIAL if you are living in the mountains in the winter! Second is the style. They go well with pretty much anything‚Ä¶ from what I wear to yoga to what I wear out to dinner... casual or a little dressier. And lastly, the convenience/comfort. They are the comfiest booties I own AND they have a zipper on the inside so they are SUPER easy to take on and off. This may seem like a small thing but when I‚Äôm running out the door quickly (which is most of the time) I always end up choosing what‚Äôs easy.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI know the holidays are coming up quick so if you are looking for a great gift idea or maybe a little gift to yourself feel free to use the code ‚Äúarielle20‚Äù for 20% your entire @bionicashoes order. I love how many of you have sent me pics of your ‚ÄúArielle Inspired‚Äù gear/outfits. Are any of you going to be twinning with me? (photo by @photograferg) #bionicaventures #bionicapartner",

          "comment": "When I was 17 years old I got my first tattoo. I gathered up enough strength to walk up to the tattoo place, hand the artist my ID clearly saying I wasn‚Äôt 18 yet and ask for a tattoo of the word ‚Äúfearless‚Äù on the inside of my middle finger. Truth be told I think I had so much conviction that the artist didn‚Äôt even question my age enough to look at the ID. He just made a photocopy and took me back to the chair.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI laugh a bit about this now because nearly 12 years later I know that the fearlessness I was searching for doesn‚Äôt actually exist. At the time I was searching for a reminder when I wanted to hit a big jump on my snowboard that I was going to be ok... that I ‚Äúhad it‚Äù... and being fearless seemed like the solution....\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned though, fear isn‚Äôt the problem and it isn‚Äôt going anywhere. While I‚Äôll likely never hit a big jump on my board ever again the fear comes up in other places... letting go of a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù career to follow my heart... public speaking... pouring my heart into words and putting it out there for the world to see and judge... making big scary steps towards goals with the total possibility of failing...\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSometimes our fears protect us... physiologically they‚Äôre designed to keep us alive. But more often than not these fears bubble up and we give them so much power that we stay small... and we play small with our lives...\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI wish I could tell you that becoming fearless is the answer... I really do. But in reality I think what we are looking for when we seek to be fearless is actually strength... it‚Äôs courage. In a momentary boost of courage we can make a small decision that changes the whole trajectory of our lives... even if it‚Äôs just to prove to ourselves, for once, we are stronger then we think we are.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo cheers to being brave. Cheers to looking at that ‚Äúthing‚Äù whatever it is and taking a big breath and saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this‚Äù. Cheers to fear... and cheers to courage.",

If you have been following along for a while now then you‚Äôve heard me talk about Tabor‚Äôs @whistlelabs GO Explore health and location tracker. It‚Äôs been one of the best ways to keep track of how we are doing with getting her enough exercise each day and it‚Äôs been amazing peace of mind for us for if she were to ever get out or lost for some reason.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nTis‚Äô the season for giving and this furry, little holiday elf wants to share the love! I am so excited to partner with @whistlelabs to share my very own holiday promo code, ARIELLE, for 30% off your purchase on the Whistle site AND give one lucky follower a Whistle device and collar! Entering is easy- just tell us in the comments how your furry friend came into your life! Winner will be chosen at random one week from today! Also- anyone who uses my code and activates their account by Dec 27th will receive a free Yeti dog bowl!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nUsing the @whistlelabs GO Explore tracker over the last few months has been SO helpful for us (especially when we are traveling and she is staying with friends and family so I can keep an eye on where she is what she is doing while I am away.) and I am so excited to get the chance to give that gift to one of you! I can't wait to read all your stories! Best of luck! #petslovewhistle #whistlelabspartner",

The place that I‚Äôm sitting in this photo now likely covered in a couple of feet of snow (it‚Äôs crazy how fast things can transition here in the mountains!) but when the road is open this is just a simple 15-min drive from my house. There are a lot of challenges when it comes to living in a small (and very expensive) mountain town but when I look around and see how beautiful it is none of those things matter to me. I just can‚Äôt help but be extremely grateful.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nLast month @eddiebauer hosted its creator summit here in Aspen and I got the chance to show off my beautiful backyard to a bunch of amazing creators. Not being a photographer myself it was so cool to me to see how they told the story of Aspen through their photos and it was fun for me to see this town I grew up in through new eyes.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThe weather this fall has been a bit crazy so even though this was taken weeks before the mountains opened we already had A TON of snow and I was so grateful for all the @eddiebauer gear I got to test out. I‚Äôve found that everything they make is super functional but they have such a great range of styled pieces to super technical piece. Even though this was a very ‚Äútown ready‚Äù outfit it was still super warm and the awesome tread on the shoes made navigating the icy conditions super easy.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIf you want the full breakdown of what I‚Äôm wearing pop over to my stories for all the details. I want to send a massive thanks to @michaelmatti for snapping these awesome photos (it was great to finally meet you in person!) and I‚Äôm curious, for all of you out there- What do you love most about where you live? #EBcontributer #liveyouradventure",

So tonight close my laptop for the day and allow the work I‚Äôve done so far to be enough... and as the new requests for my time start to come in I‚Äôll take the time to sit with the request and really feel- ‚Äúcan I show up 100% for this?‚Äù\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAnd if not? ‚ÄúThank you so much for thinking of me but I‚Äôm not available‚Äù.",

Recently I got the @Burton Jet Set jacket on @zappos and I love that it crosses over seamlessly from snowboarding to exploring.¬†¬†Like all @burton outerwear it has all the technical bells and whistles but I personally really love the length and fit. It‚Äôs long enough to ride comfortably in but fitted enough that it doesn‚Äôt look like you are swimming in it when you pair it with leggings or jeans.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIn this photo, I‚Äôm wearing the @burton Chloe beanie and the Jet Set jacket over the Women‚Äôs Oak Pullover which is literally the best snowboard hoodie I own.

I know people have mixed feelings about New Year‚Äôs resolution but I personally love the annual reminder to set new goals. One of my biggest wellness goals this year is to focus on having more fun. One way to start that resolution is to book some ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù trips where the sole purpose is just to play, explore and disconnect. For as long as I‚Äôve been booking my own travel, I‚Äôve used @bookingcom. For me, it‚Äôs always been the best way to compare options and take the stress out of the planning part of travel.

          "comment": "One of my goals from 2019 that I plan to carry into 2020 is to use less single-use plastic. It‚Äôs honestly harder than it should be to avoid because it basically eliminates half of the grocery store while shopping and even really simple things come wrapped in plastic for no reason.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nWhile avoiding single-use plastics while grocery shopping can definitely be a challenge there are some really simple changes that you can make that actually make a HUGE difference. The biggest one? Stop using single-use plastic water bottles. While I have been using a reusable water bottle for many years now the one place I still found this to be tricky is traveling (especially to places who don‚Äôt have clean drinking water on tap).\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThat is one of the reasons I love the @lifestraw GO Water bottle. @lifestraw‚Äôs technology filters out up to at least 99% of waterborne bacteria and contaminants making it the perfect travel companion. I love that I can drink safely from sinks in developing countries as well as lakes and streams when I‚Äôm out hiking.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI also LOVE that for every product purchased @lifestraw provides clean drinking water for a year to a child in need! So not only is purchasing a LifeStraw Go Water bottle go for the planet as a whole it makes a HUGE impact in the life of someone in need. For more info on @lifestraw products and mission check out my stories or head over to their website!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAnyone else adding ‚Äúusing less single-use plastics‚Äù to their New Year‚Äôs resolution list? #lifestraw #sponsored",

          "comment": "2019 has been my biggest travel year to date. Between teaching at yoga festivals/trainings, work trips for either of my businesses, and a few personal trips I had four separate international trips and literally too many domestic flights to even count.¬†¬†It seemed like every month I was away more than I was home. While I am super grateful for all the new experiences I had and all the amazing people I met along the way my heart is definitely craving some Colorado time.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFor the month of January, I plan to stay rooted here in my home state. While I plan to be home on the weekdays, pretty much every weekend in January I have something fun planned: taking a yoga workshop with my teacher, doing my Wilderness First Aid cert, speaking at a regional event for my health business which will take me to Denver, Boulder and Steamboat Springs‚Ä¶ all within a four-hour drive of my home in Aspen!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI feel like I‚Äôve got my travel kit pretty much dialed these days. My two go-to bags are the @backcountry All Around 60L Duffel and the 27L Daypack. The duffel is a new addition to my travel kit and it‚Äôs perfect for a long weekend trip in the winter because it has plenty of space for all the layers I need for Colorado winter weather/adventures. It‚Äôs also super durable so it does well being constantly thrown around. The @backcountry Daypack has been my travel backpack of choice since I got it in the spring because it seems to work perfectly whether it‚Äôs carrying my laptop and technology on the plane OR my camelback, layers, and snack on the trail.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI think sometimes we over glorify big trips where we have to fly far away and forget that hopping in the car for a short adventure can be just as magical and exciting. If you need to re-up on any of your travel gear feel free to use the code ‚ÄúARIELLE15‚Äù for 15% off *some exclusions apply*\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\np.s. since I know you are going to ask, the fleece I‚Äôm wearing is called the @backcountry Sherpa Fleece Jacket and I‚Äôm totally obsessed. #findyourbackcountry #backcountrypartner",

I used to dream of the day that my body could make this shape. I believed that by being able to do a pose like this I would  be considered a more credible teacher. So I worked and worked and when the day came that I actually was able to make this shape do you know where my mind immediately went? To the next goal. ‚ÄúWell this is nice and all but I‚Äôll REALLY be credible when I can get my top leg straight.‚Äù\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBecause of my ‚Äúif, then‚Äù mentality I tend to hit a lot of my goals but often at the sake of the enjoyment of life. I get so caught up in what‚Äôs next that I often forget to feel the magic of the journey itself.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nHere‚Äôs the thing, working on this pose actually did make me a better teacher... but it wasn‚Äôt the achieving of the pose that did. I spent hours on the mat in the process of learning this shape... because of that I gained incredible insights into the anatomy/biomechanics of the shoulders and the interplay of the hips, spine and lateral body. I also learned a lot about discomfort and what I‚Äôm capable of.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nYou‚Äôve heard me talk a lot lately about bringing more joy and lightheartedness into my life and the root of that for me is learning to be more in the present moment. Learning that even if I have goals for the future there‚Äôs no need to give up the joys along the way because in the end there will always be another pose to learn... another mountain to climb... another thing to cross of the list and, in the end, it‚Äôs journey there that matters most. It‚Äôs the ever unfolding present moments stacked on top of one another. It‚Äôs now. And now. And now. And NOW. (Photo by @alexisahrling)",

Some might say that this is my golden birthday and when I look forward at the big things I have planned for this coming year I can help but think that‚Äôs true.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nLooking back at this last year I feel an assortment of emotions. I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the amount of abundance I attracted into my life... I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the good friends that became best friends and all the new friends I‚Äôve met... Getting engaged to the man of my dreams.... Paying off all my debt... gratitude for all of you and your continued support.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBut I also look back and see the biggest internal struggles I‚Äôve faced yet... the heartbreak of my autoimmune diagnosis... the feelings of confusion... feeling lost in a life that‚Äôs quite different than I imagined and, a lot of the time, feeling at mercy to the numbers on a screen.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI‚Äôve heard it said by many from my older friends and mentors that your 20s are where you find yourself and your 30s are so amazing because you are so much more settled in who you are.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nAs I look forward to this final year of my 20s I feel ready to make some much needed changes. I feel ready to step more fully into myself and trust that when I follow my heart my choices not only serve me, but also the greatest good of all. I‚Äôm ready to be the fullest version of myself even if it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for some people out there. I‚Äôm ready to do the work that it takes so that next year, as I arrive to my next decade of life, I feel just a little more certain about what it means to be me.",

Even though I grew up here in Colorado, my focus was on riding park so the whole idea of adventure skiing/snowboarding is new to me.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nThis will be my split board‚Äôs first adventure off the resort and my first time skinning up something that wasn‚Äôt recently groomed... I don‚Äôt know if any of you can relate but I‚Äôve wanted to get into the backcountry for awhile now but I just didn‚Äôt know where to start.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nFinally, this year I just pulled the trigger... I stopped waiting for something to happen and made it happen! This hut trip is guided and also an avalanche course so I can get some real hands on experience with some people who REALLY know their stuff.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nOne of the biggest things I‚Äôve learned over the last few years is in order to achieve my goals I have to be comfortable being uncomfortable... I have to be ok with not having it all figured out and starting anyways. I have to ask the right questions... seek out the right people... and be willing to invest in myself and my future.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo maybe this is just a 3-day hut trip... or maybe this is the gateway into the next chapter of my life. Either way, I‚Äôm excited for the adventure.",

So each winter, you'll witness a new frozen world, that will look different from the previous year. It's impossible to describe the feeling of standing inside a glacier, you'll hear the streams flowing and the ice slowly melting and moving. Something everyone should experience one day. Is Iceland on your bucket list? Would you guys like to see more videos like this? \n#Iceland @localguide",

So each winter, you'll witness a new frozen world, that will look different from the previous year. It's impossible to describe the feeling of standing inside a glacier, you'll hear the streams flowing and the ice slowly melting and moving. Something everyone should experience one day.

This life is incredibly fun and full surprises. The best lesson I‚Äôve learned is; find your passion, what you thrive for and follow that. It will lead you incredible places. I still remember when I was trying to chase something that wasn‚Äôt right for me, but I thought it was the only way. Both in work and relationships. Just remember, there are so many different paths to take in this life. Sometimes all it takes is just a little bit of courage. ü§≠ü•≥ But in the end, what I‚Äôm most grateful for is you ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è #2019 #2020",

          "comment": "During my time at this beach in Costa Rica was one of my favourite moments of 2019. I had just finished up doing a project so the gang and I went to the beach, hung out, drank some beers, ate some quesadillas and completely detached from the world.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIt was a great time with some special humans and it was a moment where I didn‚Äôt have a worry about anything else that was going on in the world except for what we were doing on that beach... Which leads me into a bit of a story time! ü§ìüìñ\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI was talking to my buddy the other day about how I want to be back from a project in Iceland that we‚Äôre planning on a certain day so that I have some time to relax before I start a new project.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIt turns out the flights we are looking at get me home the day I start the next project. I looked at my friend and said, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt want to have to be back on this day buddy...‚Äù ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and went, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all part of the job, buddy...‚Äù\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nYes, we say buddy WAY TOO MUCH but the point I‚Äôm trying to make is that a lot of what you see me share on here seems like everything I am doing is all fun and games where I am gallivanting all over the place with zero worries. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBUT in reality I am working... Constantly. A LOT more than I used to work at my old 9-5 job.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI‚Äôm not trying to complain about my job at all because I absolutely love it and it‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. But hours in front of a screen emailing clients, editing batches of images for days, hopping on back to back flights from project to project and going weeks catching every sunrise/sunset with hardly any downtime can really catch up to you.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo in 2020 I am going to make a conscious effort to have more moments like these ones.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSwipe through this series to see what we got up to. The only time we picked up our cameras was for fun, we went swimming, ‚Äústole‚Äù some dudes surfboards, laughed and had GOOD TIMES only.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nALSO, some of these photos are taken by @chelseamealo! She is in A LOT of my photos I‚Äôve been taking but she is not only a fantastic model but an amazing photographer as well. Make sure you check her out if you haven‚Äôt yet!\n\n#AllAboutAdventures",

          "comment": "During my time at this beach in Costa Rica was one of my favourite moments of 2019. I had just finished up doing a project so the gang and I went to the beach, hung out, drank some beers, ate some quesadillas and completely detached from the world.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIt was a great time with some special humans and it was a moment where I didn‚Äôt have a worry about anything else that was going on in the world except for what we were doing on that beach... Which leads me into a bit of a story time! ü§ìüìñ\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI was talking to my buddy the other day about how I want to be back from a project in Iceland that we‚Äôre planning on a certain day so that I have some time to relax before I start a new project.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nIt turns out the flights we are looking at get me home the day I start the next project. I looked at my friend and said, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt want to have to be back on this day buddy...‚Äù ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nHe looked me dead in the eyes and went, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all part of the job, buddy...‚Äù\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nYes, we say buddy WAY TOO MUCH but the point I‚Äôm trying to make is that a lot of what you see me share on here seems like everything I am doing is all fun and games where I am gallivanting all over the place with zero worries. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nBUT in reality I am working... Constantly. A LOT more than I used to work at my old 9-5 job.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI‚Äôm not trying to complain about my job at all because I absolutely love it and it‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. But hours in front of a screen emailing clients, editing batches of images for days, hopping on back to back flights from project to project and going weeks catching every sunrise/sunset with hardly any downtime can really catch up to you.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSo in 2020 I am going to make a conscious effort to have more moments like these ones.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nSwipe through this series to see what we got up to. The only time we picked up our cameras was for fun, we went swimming, ‚Äústole‚Äù some dudes surfboards, laughed and had GOOD TIMES only.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nALSO, some of these photos are taken by @chelseamealo! She is in A LOT of my photos I‚Äôve been taking but she is not only a fantastic model but an amazing photographer as well. Make sure you check her out if you haven‚Äôt yet!\n\n#AllAboutAdventures",

          "comment": "I am the child of an extremely difficult divorce.\nA divorce that shaped my teenage years and fostered a grudge that I held on to clear into my mid-twenties.\nAnd so, for those of us who‚Äôs families don‚Äôt look like something out of a Hallmark card, Christmas can be especially brutal.\nMy mom and I spent a lot of our holidays off on odd excursions together. Whether it was to foster her sense of adventure in me or to distract from the fact that we were sort of on our own...I can‚Äôt be certain. But it worked.\nWe‚Äôd go off and stay in random hotels in the city or spend hours driving through the dark corners of Vermont looking for tiny Bed & Breakfasts.\nChristmas has been different every single year since I was 15. And so, that lack of tradition has become tradition in and of itself.\nKeith and the dogs and I have spent Christmas Eve asleep in the back of his pickup truck in the dirt parking lot of Horseshoe Bend. We‚Äôve eaten pancakes around a campfire in the middle of the desert and been trapped in a whiteout snowstorm on the side of the road and shared the first moments of Christmas on a crowded red eye flight full of strangers.\nThis year is different yet again, as Keith and I will spend tomorrow in the hospital getting some tests done. Some Christmas Eve huh?! (More on that later though.)\nThe simple fact is, we don‚Äôt get to choose a lot of what happens to us in this life. We are products of circumstance and luck and timing.\nWhat we do get to choose is what we do with all of that. Perspective is always a choice.\nAnd so, this holiday season, whether you‚Äôre out in the wild or alone in an apartment or surrounded by family or stuck somewhere less than ideal...I hope you find your joy.\nThat‚Äôs the only thing this was all supposed to be about anyway, right?\nWishing you all a very happy Christmas üß°\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nüì∑: my pal @abbihearne",

That‚Äôs all fine and well and I‚Äôve got nothing against it. Hell, I‚Äôve basically made a whole life out of running away. But I‚Äôd like to lend a moment in the spotlight to the things many of us are lucky enough to have right within reach.\nOld friends and old photo albums and all the music we used to dance to when we were kids. Stories told by our parents and their parents. Memories of times we loved and times we didn‚Äôt love so much, but survived nonetheless.\nI‚Äôve spent the past few months looking back instead of ahead, and I‚Äôm sure that sounds like a bad thing at first glance, but it‚Äôs been wonderful. I‚Äôve visited childhood friends and surprised my grandmother back East. I‚Äôve snuggled my nephew and played board games with my brother and dug through old photos of my beloved childhood home that used to be too painful to look at.\nAnd I suppose what I‚Äôve come to find in all of this is a much needed sense of perspective in this busy round-and-round life of mine...\nSometimes remembering who we were is just as important as discovering who we are.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nFirst photo: @abbihearne\nSecond photo: My mom üòâ",

I opened my eyes maybe 20 minutes later and found a set of vibrant yellow ones staring back at me. Directly across, in a large inlet among the wacos, two owls watched me inquisitively.\nSlowly, I reached for my camera and managed to capture this photograph you see here.\nI sat in that canyon with the dogs running around careless for almost 3 hours until my sunlight was gone, and those owls sat there too.\nEvery single winter, I‚Äôve gone back into this canyon and every single winter, one or more owls have been in this very nest.\nSo I go each year and I talk to them.\nThe dogs can‚Äôt see them. They must think I‚Äôve gone mad sitting there talking up into the sky, so they tear off around the corner, uninterested, and it‚Äôs just me and the owls.\nIt‚Äôs hard these days to come upon things that haven‚Äôt changed in 5 years. The world is so rapidly growing and changing and expanding and imploding.\nEvery year, I hold my breath rounding the corner to where I hope our eyes will meet. And every year, I‚Äôve cried seeing those sunflower eyes exactly where they should be.\nIt‚Äôs a gift to slip through these cracks in the earth out here and know that at least, for now, those that call them home have their shelter. I was so happy to see them again today.\nSo...if at any point in the last few years you‚Äôve asked where I am, perhaps you‚Äôll understand why I don‚Äôt answer.",

          "comment": "One of the most important things I‚Äôve done for myself in the last year or so is to stop trying to be good at everything and just focus on being great at one thing.\nI‚Äôm a great writer. But I‚Äôm just an okay environmentalist...just a decent advocate...just a relatively passable photographer...just a mildly politically aware citizen. I try my best, but I can‚Äôt be great at it all.\nAnd yet sometimes I feel guilty for not being vocal enough about every single issue of our time, as though my somewhat public presence warrants me to be an expert at everything. I suppose I could pretend to be...\nI could post links to websites I didn‚Äôt read, chime in on arguments I don‚Äôt know enough about, pretend to speak on experiences I‚Äôve never actually lived. I certainly see enough people doing that anyway...\nBut few things seem more disingenuous.\nAnd I‚Äôm not here to be disingenuous.\nWhat I‚Äôve tried to be better at, instead, is listening. Listening to people who ARE the experts in these areas, the people who HAVE lived these experiences.\nIt‚Äôs one thing to use your voice, but it‚Äôs a whole other thing to speak over other more knowledgeable voices for the sake of your own appearance.\nAnd so I thought perhaps this post could serve as a community bulletin board. Are there accounts you like that discuss certain topics, certain demographics, certain issues that you want people to know about? I‚Äôd love if you‚Äôd post them here.\nHere‚Äôs a few of mine: @hownottotravellikeabasicbitch @outdooradvocacy @pattiegonia @unlikelyhikers @browngirlsclimb @accessfund @nativesoutdoors @sheliftgrams",

I‚Äôll also be doing a Live Q&A, and a giveaway so you can kit out your rig with a new rack system in 2020. Hope to see you guys over there! And if there‚Äôs anything else you can think of that you‚Äôd like us to talk about during our takeover, let me know in the comments. For example, do we want a live performance of Keith singing Christmas songs? I know I do, but please say yes so I can blame it on you guys üëÄ",

Every year is a different dirt road, a different sunrise, a different campsite.\nOne thing that is consistent is our trusty metal matriarch, Bertha, and her willingness to get us as far as we want to go. On days like these, I love that I earn 3% Cash Back at U.S. gas stations with my @AmericanExpress Blue Cash Preferred Card and 6% Cash Back on select U.S. streaming subscriptions (Terms apply) so I can start listening to holiday music as early as I please.\nCheck out the link in my bio to learn more about the Card. #AmexAmbassador #AmexBlueCashPreferred #Ad",

The website contains a full resource library ranging from everything to Public & Tribal Lands to Leave No Trace to current political bills, acts, proposals etc. that have an impact on the public lands we all love. You can even sign up with your email to be alerted on updates pertaining to certain bills and their statuses! You can also see a plethora of information on how to get involved, which was the driving force behind this creation of Katie‚Äôs.\nSo many of us want to help but we feel helpless. We don‚Äôt know where to go or what to do or who to call or where to donate. @outdooradvocacy hopes to change all of that.

But I‚Äôm just an okay environmentalist...just a decent advocate...just a relatively passable photographer...just a mildly politically aware citizen. I try my best, but I can‚Äôt be great at it all.\nAnd yet sometimes I feel guilty for not being vocal enough about every single issue of our time, as though my somewhat public presence warrants me to be an expert at everything. I suppose I could pretend to be...\nI could post links to websites I didn‚Äôt read, chime in on arguments I don‚Äôt know enough about, pretend to speak on experiences I‚Äôve never actually lived. I certainly see enough people doing that anyway...\nBut few things seem more disingenuous.\nAnd I‚Äôm not here to be disingenuous.\nWhat I‚Äôve tried to be better at, instead, is listening. Listening to people who ARE the experts in these areas, the people who HAVE lived these experiences.\nIt‚Äôs one thing to use your voice, but it‚Äôs a whole other thing to speak over other more knowledgeable voices for the sake of your own appearance.\nAnd so I thought perhaps this post could serve as a community bulletin board. Are there accounts you like that discuss certain topics, certain demographics, certain issues that you want people to know about? I‚Äôd love if you‚Äôd post them here.\nHere‚Äôs a few of mine: @hownottotravellikeabasicbitch @outdooradvocacy @pattiegonia @unlikelyhikers @browngirlsclimb @accessfund @nativesoutdoors @sheliftgrams",

That‚Äôs all fine and well and I‚Äôve got nothing against it. Hell, I‚Äôve basically made a whole life out of running away. But I‚Äôd like to lend a moment in the spotlight to the things many of us are lucky enough to have right within reach.\nOld friends and old photo albums and all the music we used to dance to when we were kids. Stories told by our parents and their parents. Memories of times we loved and times we didn‚Äôt love so much, but survived nonetheless.\nI‚Äôve spent the past few months looking back instead of ahead, and I‚Äôm sure that sounds like a bad thing at first glance, but it‚Äôs been wonderful. I‚Äôve visited childhood friends and surprised my grandmother back East. I‚Äôve snuggled my nephew and played board games with my brother and dug through old photos of my beloved childhood home that used to be too painful to look at.\nAnd I suppose what I‚Äôve come to find in all of this is a much needed sense of perspective in this busy round-and-round life of mine...\nSometimes remembering who we were is just as important as discovering who we are.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nFirst photo: @abbihearne\nSecond photo: My mom üòâ",

I‚Äôll also be doing a Live Q&A, and a giveaway so you can kit out your rig with a new rack system in 2020. Hope to see you guys over there! And if there‚Äôs anything else you can think of that you‚Äôd like us to talk about during our takeover, let me know in the comments. For example, do we want a live performance of Keith singing Christmas songs? I know I do, but please say yes so I can blame it on you guys üëÄ",

          "comment": "I am the child of an extremely difficult divorce.\nA divorce that shaped my teenage years and fostered a grudge that I held on to clear into my mid-twenties.\nAnd so, for those of us who‚Äôs families don‚Äôt look like something out of a Hallmark card, Christmas can be especially brutal.\nMy mom and I spent a lot of our holidays off on odd excursions together. Whether it was to foster her sense of adventure in me or to distract from the fact that we were sort of on our own...I can‚Äôt be certain. But it worked.\nWe‚Äôd go off and stay in random hotels in the city or spend hours driving through the dark corners of Vermont looking for tiny Bed & Breakfasts.\nChristmas has been different every single year since I was 15. And so, that lack of tradition has become tradition in and of itself.\nKeith and the dogs and I have spent Christmas Eve asleep in the back of his pickup truck in the dirt parking lot of Horseshoe Bend. We‚Äôve eaten pancakes around a campfire in the middle of the desert and been trapped in a whiteout snowstorm on the side of the road and shared the first moments of Christmas on a crowded red eye flight full of strangers.\nThis year is different yet again, as Keith and I will spend tomorrow in the hospital getting some tests done. Some Christmas Eve huh?! (More on that later though.)\nThe simple fact is, we don‚Äôt get to choose a lot of what happens to us in this life. We are products of circumstance and luck and timing.\nWhat we do get to choose is what we do with all of that. Perspective is always a choice.\nAnd so, this holiday season, whether you‚Äôre out in the wild or alone in an apartment or surrounded by family or stuck somewhere less than ideal...I hope you find your joy.\nThat‚Äôs the only thing this was all supposed to be about anyway, right?\nWishing you all a very happy Christmas üß°\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nüì∑: my pal @abbihearne",

Though I kicked it off with a three week group trip through Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, with 20 other strangers - which was SO amazing, it helped me in getting comfortable with traveling and I met some amazing folks. I would have never dreamt that almost decade later I would be hosting my own international group travel trips.

I think we took three photos on this hike and instead spent it catching up and trying not to blow off the ridge with the intense winds. I also made a story post the other day asking yal for feedback on ‚Äòcurated‚Äô versus raw, unedited stories and how I feel meant influencers/photographers/bloggers on here are moving to more curated stories & I asked what yal would like to see and I was blown away at the comments and messages back suggesting ‚ÄòKeep doing what I‚Äôm doing‚Äô and how one of the reasons yal follow is because it isn‚Äôt always perfect and it‚Äôs a mix of everyday life as well.

You may not always ‚Äòlike‚Äô the person ü§£ & there will be arguments and hard days but it‚Äôs that choice to love them through it. They say arguments during wedding planning is normal? Haha we are doing pretty good. *\n*\nI get a lot of messages asking how wedding planning is coming along. When are we getting married? Have I picked out my dress? Is Timber going to be involved? Are we eloping? Will it be in the mountains? Are you going to tell your audience? How bigs your wedding? How many bridesmaid? Are you getting a videographer? Honeymoon? Stagette plans? The questions go on. To answer those questions generally, wedding planning is coming along very nicely! We are doing things a bit less traditional and conscious of spending, but I guess that‚Äôs for you to wait and see how so. haha we are not disclosing where we are getting married but the ceremony will be in the mountains. The big things are booked. Venues ‚úÖ Photographer ‚úÖ Videographer ‚úÖ Food ‚úÖ Save the dates ‚úÖ Bridesmaid dresses ‚úÖ Honeymoon is semi decided. I‚Äôm slowly gathering decor etc and not worrying too much about small details till the new year. *\n*\nWhen it comes to a wedding shower and stagette - when I got engaged I think I even asked, uh does everyone have to have those things? Lol Seems like just so much planning and asks from people - so I am still figuring that out. The ceremony and celebration is what matters the most to us ‚ù§Ô∏è We are so excited to have all the people we love together to celebrate in July.",

Our family use to vacation together every Christmas and as us four sisters got older we found it harder and harder to get schedules to match up to make it work, so my folks started vacationing on their own a few years ago. This year they asked Craig and I if we wanted to join them as we both get time off workin‚Äô for the school board and we jumped on the opportunity pretty quickly. Thinking about the past year and all the amazing things that happened, and then lookin‚Äô into 2020 and what there is in store. Between my work and travel opportunities, our wedding, my sisters wedding and more I am feelin‚Äô pretty excited about the year ahead! What are you lookin‚Äô forward to in 2020!? #freshairandfreedom #manzanillo #mexico",

A few days ago I was out at the dog park and @timber_tails ended up getting along really well with another dog ‚ÄòPoncho‚Äô so I ended up walking along with his owner @torireikie who recently moved to Red Deer a couple months prior. I had asked her if she wanted to join us for a little mountain trip since we were planning to go solo, and she was quick to say yes. It‚Äôs always nice to have company in the mountains, and Timber had a friends to hike with too! I also reached out to my friend Natasha @eatpraywtf asking if she wanted to join, and she was keen, though had drove to Calgary with her 9 month old Amadeus, where she planned to stay for a couple days. They didn‚Äôt have any hiking gear with them and I told her to not worry and that I‚Äôd bring her everything she would need, clothing, boots, poles etc. She even purchased a baby carrier that evening ‚ù§Ô∏è This was Amadeus‚Äô first hike and I was so happy to be a part of it! The weather held up for us and we had a great time out in Kananaskis. Amadeus‚Äô was the happiest baby in his carrier, not making a peep the entire way up and down. Wednesday was a successful day, minus the fact I went into it feelin‚Äô a bit sick and woke up the next day even more sick #worthit #freshairandfreedom",

Christmas is an enjoyable time for many, though for others it's a time of hardship, and that's where the Salvation Army comes in, as a place for people to turn to for support. Growing up I remember during Christmas there would always be Salvation Army donation locations at the mall, and at the grocery stores, where volunteers were present with the brightest smiles and their bells ringing. To this day it still warms my heart to see the same thing present around the holidays. There are SO many ways to get involved with the Salvation Army and over the next couple weeks I plan to share with you these ways, along with information about the organization, the services they provide, because #EveryoneNeedsanArmy #sponsored",

Truth is I just love to workout and it‚Äôs part of the enjoyment in travel and vacationing for me - it sets the tone for the day. During the day we aren‚Äôt doing much, it‚Äôs been poolside/ocean side chillin‚Äô for the most part (though we did have a hiking day and walk the beach everyday), so getting up early and getting an hour or so workout in allows me to ‚Äòchill‚Äô for the rest of it - or else I may go crazy üòù. Being a runner makes it a bit easier to workout while traveling also, as all I need is my running shoes and some workout clothes and I am set. Over the years running has allowed me to explore the areas I travel to a lot easier where I am able to get in kms quicker. Body weight workouts and circuits are also common in my workout routine at home and on the go! I bought a skipping rope for this trip and it has been great as I do a ton of skipping at home and it‚Äôs easy to travel with ‚ù§Ô∏è | I also eat pretty well when I‚Äôm traveling as I have a sensitive stomach - so try to stay conscious of that (but trust me I indulge too) ‚ò∫Ô∏è I also walk everywhereeeee I can instead of using public transit - and I love my after dinner walks while away and at home - the kms add up! | The fact that Craig also values fitness makes it easier as we keep each other motivated when we are away from town, and at home #fitness #travel #freshairandfreedom",

Flying to Mexico to wrap it all up is the perfect way to end the year. We started this morning with a little hike all together with my folks to the top of the ‚ÄòMountain‚Äô to the left of us in the background, a post gym sesh and now we are going to be relaxing until our dinner reservation and trying to stay up till midnight, to say hello to 2020. Wish us luck. Happy New Year everyone! üëãüèº üí• #mexico #2019",

          "comment": "Hey friends! I know it is a very busy time of year, which can often become centred around gifts, Christmas parties, scrambling to get things done at work before a bit of a 'break', though I wanted to take a moment of your time to chat about how we can come together and give back. You can contribute to @salvationarmycanada by heading to the link in my bio, and donating online! The donations assist in building and supporting many unique programs, some of which I didn't even know about prior to partnering. For example, at a long-term care facility in St.John‚Äôs, NL, pet therapy is helping seniors living with dementia, which is something I think is SO neat. Timber has been SUCH a light in my world and I can see pet therapy being beneficial to many others. I want to thank ALL of you in advance for reading through all of these posts and taking the time to donate whether online or in person. I encourage you to further look into the programs they offer and how else you can potentially get involved in the future, because #EveryoneNeedsanArmy #sponsored",

They help people from all walks of life overcome their challenges and get back on their feet.

You may not always ‚Äòlike‚Äô the person ü§£ & there will be arguments and hard days but it‚Äôs that choice to love them through it. They say arguments during wedding planning is normal? Haha we are doing pretty good. *\n*\nI get a lot of messages asking how wedding planning is coming along. When are we getting married? Have I picked out my dress? Is Timber going to be involved? Are we eloping? Will it be in the mountains? Are you going to tell your audience? How bigs your wedding? How many bridesmaid? Are you getting a videographer? Honeymoon? Stagette plans? The questions go on. To answer those questions generally, wedding planning is coming along very nicely! We are doing things a bit less traditional and conscious of spending, but I guess that‚Äôs for you to wait and see how so. haha we are not disclosing where we are getting married but the ceremony will be in the mountains. The big things are booked. Venues ‚úÖ Photographer ‚úÖ Videographer ‚úÖ Food ‚úÖ Save the dates ‚úÖ Bridesmaid dresses ‚úÖ Honeymoon is semi decided. I‚Äôm slowly gathering decor etc and not worrying too much about small details till the new year. *\n*\nWhen it comes to a wedding shower and stagette - when I got engaged I think I even asked, uh does everyone have to have those things? Lol Seems like just so much planning and asks from people - so I am still figuring that out. The ceremony and celebration is what matters the most to us ‚ù§Ô∏è We are so excited to have all the people we love together to celebrate in July.",

Christmas is an enjoyable time for many, though for others it's a time of hardship, and that's where the Salvation Army comes in, as a place for people to turn to for support. Growing up I remember during Christmas there would always be Salvation Army donation locations at the mall, and at the grocery stores, where volunteers were present with the brightest smiles and their bells ringing. To this day it still warms my heart to see the same thing present around the holidays. There are SO many ways to get involved with the Salvation Army and over the next couple weeks I plan to share with you these ways, along with information about the organization, the services they provide, because #EveryoneNeedsanArmy #sponsored",

A few days ago I was out at the dog park and @timber_tails ended up getting along really well with another dog ‚ÄòPoncho‚Äô so I ended up walking along with his owner @torireikie who recently moved to Red Deer a couple months prior. I had asked her if she wanted to join us for a little mountain trip since we were planning to go solo, and she was quick to say yes. It‚Äôs always nice to have company in the mountains, and Timber had a friends to hike with too! I also reached out to my friend Natasha @eatpraywtf asking if she wanted to join, and she was keen, though had drove to Calgary with her 9 month old Amadeus, where she planned to stay for a couple days. They didn‚Äôt have any hiking gear with them and I told her to not worry and that I‚Äôd bring her everything she would need, clothing, boots, poles etc. She even purchased a baby carrier that evening ‚ù§Ô∏è This was Amadeus‚Äô first hike and I was so happy to be a part of it! The weather held up for us and we had a great time out in Kananaskis. Amadeus‚Äô was the happiest baby in his carrier, not making a peep the entire way up and down. Wednesday was a successful day, minus the fact I went into it feelin‚Äô a bit sick and woke up the next day even more sick #worthit #freshairandfreedom",

I know it is a very busy time of year, which can often become centred around gifts, Christmas parties, scrambling to get things done at work before a bit of a 'break', though I wanted to take a moment of your time to chat about how we can come together and give back. You can contribute to @salvationarmycanada by heading to the link in my bio, and donating online! The donations assist in building and supporting many unique programs, some of which I didn't even know about prior to partnering. For example, at a long-term care facility in St.John‚Äôs, NL, pet therapy is helping seniors living with dementia, which is something I think is SO neat. Timber has been SUCH a light in my world and I can see pet therapy being beneficial to many others. I want to thank ALL of you in advance for reading through all of these posts and taking the time to donate whether online or in person. I encourage you to further look into the programs they offer and how else you can potentially get involved in the future, because #EveryoneNeedsanArmy #sponsored",

Our family use to vacation together every Christmas and as us four sisters got older we found it harder and harder to get schedules to match up to make it work, so my folks started vacationing on their own a few years ago. This year they asked Craig and I if we wanted to join them as we both get time off workin‚Äô for the school board and we jumped on the opportunity pretty quickly. Thinking about the past year and all the amazing things that happened, and then lookin‚Äô into 2020 and what there is in store. Between my work and travel opportunities, our wedding, my sisters wedding and more I am feelin‚Äô pretty excited about the year ahead! What are you lookin‚Äô forward to in 2020!? #freshairandfreedom #manzanillo #mexico",

From all the memories with this one, to graduating, hosting my first international trip to Peru, moving into our house together, getting engaged, being a part of friends weddings, Craig starting his new job, continuous social media opportunities, subbing full-time when home, my sister getting engaged and all the other little trips and things in between. Flying to Mexico to wrap it all up is the perfect way to end the year. We started this morning with a little hike all together with my folks to the top of the ‚ÄòMountain‚Äô to the left of us in the background, a post gym sesh and now we are going to be relaxing until our dinner reservation and trying to stay up till midnight, to say hello to 2020.

Truth is I just love to workout and it‚Äôs part of the enjoyment in travel and vacationing for me - it sets the tone for the day. During the day we aren‚Äôt doing much, it‚Äôs been poolside/ocean side chillin‚Äô for the most part (though we did have a hiking day and walk the beach everyday), so getting up early and getting an hour or so workout in allows me to ‚Äòchill‚Äô for the rest of it - or else I may go crazy üòù. Being a runner makes it a bit easier to workout while traveling also, as all I need is my running shoes and some workout clothes and I am set. Over the years running has allowed me to explore the areas I travel to a lot easier where I am able to get in kms quicker. Body weight workouts and circuits are also common in my workout routine at home and on the go! I bought a skipping rope for this trip and it has been great as I do a ton of skipping at home and it‚Äôs easy to travel with ‚ù§Ô∏è | I also eat pretty well when I‚Äôm traveling as I have a sensitive stomach - so try to stay conscious of that (but trust me I indulge too) ‚ò∫Ô∏è I also walk everywhereeeee I can instead of using public transit - and I love my after dinner walks while away and at home - the kms add up! | The fact that Craig also values fitness makes it easier as we keep each other motivated when we are away from town, and at home #fitness #travel #freshairandfreedom",

          "comment": "At the end of last season I went on an incredible all women's sail-to-ski trip in northern Norway. We spent 11 days on the boat sailing through the Lyngen Alps, stopping each day to explore a new island. On our trip we only encountered two other women and only one other splitboarder. Which I thought was crazy üòù My community at home is so large and female dominated that I forget how small of a sport splitboarding is and how few women participate. So, in hopes of changing that, I gave my entire setup to a local snowboarder in Troms√∏. As this season approached I needed a new setup and found exactly what I was looking for on @backcountry üíÉüèº\n.\n\nTo help more of you to get out there I‚Äôm excited to GIVEAWAY an AST 1 course with @altusmtnguides. If you want to get into the backcountry this is the first thing you should do to educate yourself on safe backcountry travel. Just like this photo and tag a friend in the comments to be entered to win. GIVEAWAY CLOSED - Congratulations @msutts üåà\n\nSecond thing you should do is get the right gear. Luckily you read far enough down in my caption that you can use my code CALEY15 for 15% off your first purchase on backcountry.com and save some dollars on that not so cheap splitboarding setup ü§†#Sponsored *exclusions apply*",

Every minute of my day this past week was filled with something fun ü§† surfing, backyard bbq‚Äôs, movie premieres, dinners, skate jams, art shows, live music, smoothies, sea turtles and conservation workshops. I flew to Hawaii alone and left with time well spent with so many old and new friends. This festival embodied everything I love so much about surfing and the community that comes with it.\n\nOne of my biggest takeaways from the trip was our day with @vanssurf @sustainablecoastlines and @changingtidesfoundation . I learnt more in-depth about single-use plastic, ocean health, gardening, food composting and how we need to change our linear way of thinking to a more circular way of living.

          "comment": "At the end of last season I went on an incredible all women's sail-to-ski trip in northern Norway. We spent 11 days on the boat sailing through the Lyngen Alps, stopping each day to explore a new island. On our trip we only encountered two other women and only one other splitboarder. Which I thought was crazy üòù My community at home is so large and female dominated that I forget how small of a sport splitboarding is and how few women participate. So, in hopes of changing that, I gave my entire setup to a local snowboarder in Troms√∏. As this season approached I needed a new setup and found exactly what I was looking for on @backcountry üíÉüèº\n.\n\nTo help more of you to get out there I‚Äôm excited to GIVEAWAY an AST 1 course with @altusmtnguides. If you want to get into the backcountry this is the first thing you should do to educate yourself on safe backcountry travel. Just like this photo and tag a friend in the comments to be entered to win. GIVEAWAY CLOSED - Congratulations @msutts üåà\n\nSecond thing you should do is get the right gear. Luckily you read far enough down in my caption that you can use my code CALEY15 for 15% off your first purchase on backcountry.com and save some dollars on that not so cheap splitboarding setup ü§†#Sponsored *exclusions apply*",

Every minute of my day this past week was filled with something fun ü§† surfing, backyard bbq‚Äôs, movie premieres, dinners, skate jams, art shows, live music, smoothies, sea turtles and conservation workshops. I flew to Hawaii alone and left with time well spent with so many old and new friends. This festival embodied everything I love so much about surfing and the community that comes with it.\n\nOne of my biggest takeaways from the trip was our day with @vanssurf @sustainablecoastlines and @changingtidesfoundation . I learnt more in-depth about single-use plastic, ocean health, gardening, food composting and how we need to change our linear way of thinking to a more circular way of living. Can‚Äôt thank Vans enough for bringing me along üôåüèæüíï @vanstriplecrownsurf",

It was something I had been dreaming of for so long. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIt happened at the perfect time in my life. It took me a long time to accept and love the part of myself that loves to wear dresses and twirl around in chiffon.

          "comment": "2019 was a big year. We bought a house. We started a foundation. I tore my ACL. I reached the highest point in the world. I had knee surgery. I crewed @rob.lea on his English Channel swim. I hiked up to the highest peak in the UK 6 weeks after knee surgery. We got married. I rode my bike almost a thousand miles with Rob and crewed him on his ride across America. I testified to the Senate about how climate change is affecting the mountains. I marched for climate. I shared my story with hundreds of people in real life in the many keynotes and talks I did. I took my nieces and nephews camping and taught them how to climb and ski.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nBut perhaps what I‚Äôm most proud of in 2019 is learning how to love myself. I know that sounds clich√©, but hear me out. I used to approach skiing and mountaineering as an escape and a form of self punishment. I would always try to go a little harder and push myself to hurt a little more.  It was like a drug, a way of punishing my body and escaping my inner demons.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIt taken me a long time to work through that and come to a place where I approach what I do from a place of self love. To be able to stop when it hurts, to rest when I need it. To say no to those things that don‚Äôt serve me. Where it‚Äôs not about disciplining my body  but it‚Äôs about passion and love, for the places I‚Äôm in, for my partners and for myself. Here‚Äôs to more of that in 2020. Whatever we do in 2020, let‚Äôs do it from a place of love.",

I remember when I first learned about Seasonal Affective Depression, I felt a wave of relief. I finally had language to describe what I had been feeling. I also learned that skiing was a treatment. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nSkiing and mountaineering have become a way of coping with depression. It‚Äôs a way of finding light in the darkness of my mind. It‚Äôs a way to survive the dark winter months. I thought I‚Äôd share this today on the winter solstice. After today, every day will get a little bit brighter. ‚Å£happy winter solstice to all my friends in the Northern Hemisphere. I‚Äôm so grateful to have a space here where I can talk about this stuff.

          "comment": "Asking my mom to be the officiant at our wedding had significance to me in so many ways. First, it was a celebration of our mother-daughter relationship that has grown with strength through the years! She knows me so well, and her open endorsement of my marriage was an important acknowledgement. Her example of partnership with my dad for more than 40 years is a representation of the power of marriage. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nSecondly, it was a tribute to the times that embrace women in positions of power that previously had been deemed only for men. I grew up Catholic. Seeing the restrictions set on women in what they could do or not do sent a strong signal to me as a young person about a woman‚Äôs place. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThirdly, it was so much fun to write the ceremony together! We were creative, imaginative and put together a meaningful ceremony to launch an important transition in my life! We were inspired by many different traditions and incorporated them into the ceremony. It was spiritual with a lot of humor, exactly the tone we wanted to set for our wedding. I am so grateful she took on the extra work of officiating. I couldn‚Äôt have imagined anyone else marrying us.‚Å£ I would highly recommend other people who are looking for an officiant to consider a family member! It is such a fun way to bond! \nPhoto: @erinorthcutt",

          "comment": "Today marks 7 months since I had ACL replacement surgery. To my fellow knee injury buddies, I thought I‚Äôd share some of what I‚Äôve learned in my recovery so far. ‚Å£Here are my top twelve:\n‚Å£\n1.  It‚Äôs ok to have moments of wallowing in self despair. Being depressed because you‚Äôre unable to do what you love is completely understandable. It takes time to find the silver lining with injuries. Or maybe you never find it. For those struggling, I see you. You‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs going to be ok.‚Å£ I‚Äôve found @headspace to be really useful during challenging times (unsponsored).\n2.  Focus on what you can do, not what you can‚Äôt.‚Å£\n3.  Remember all the ways it could be worse.‚Å£\n4.  If you‚Äôve torn your ACL, find a physical therapist that you love because you‚Äôve going to be spending a lot of time together. Cherish each day of having a personal trainer and have fun with it! Grateful for you @smmurnin!\n5.  Don‚Äôt compare yourself to your pre-injury state. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others. Focus on doing the best you can everyday. (still struggle with this, not just with knee stuff)‚Å£\n6.  Celebrate the little and big successes in your recovery.‚Å£\n7.  Injuries create space for new growth and opportunities to do things you wouldn‚Äôt expect. Enjoy the unexpected. ‚Å£\n8.  Stay connected to people by taking group fitness classes when you‚Äôre ready. Swim if you can‚Äôt weight bear (get a pull buoy so you just use your arms, not your legs). Also, follow @theaclclub.‚Å£\n9.  I found reformer Pilates to be an awesome way to strengthen, stretch and re-learn how to balance when I was injured. \n10.  Try dry needling, kinesio tape and other recovery tools like @ntrecovery legs.‚Å£\n11.  Try CBD for pain/discomfort and turmeric for swelling. For me, @gaiaherbs hemp products were a life-saver.‚Å£\n12.  Try to get a little bit of sunshine each day, even if you‚Äôre on crutches. For me, the vitamin D is imperative to my mood. \nI‚Äôd love to hear your tips! Share in the comments below! \n@keen #keenambassador",

I can think of few places more romantic than the Alps over the holidays. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nToday, our luggage showed up after a 20-hour delay and we skied one of the longest in-bounds runs in Europe, about 6,000‚Äô vertical!‚Å£\nIt‚Äôs hard to comprehend the scale of the Alps. There are few runs in North America that are this long. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe views from the top and the excitement of the speed on the downhill burned off the jet leg and the knee felt good and strong today! Can‚Äôt wait to continue exploring tomorrow. ‚Å£",

I never had a new pair of skis until a sponsor gave them to me. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nI learned how to ski when I was a kiddo, but I never raced or skied competitively growing up. I did take a few lessons and I cherished every one of them. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nSnow sports can be incredibly difficult to get in to, especially as an adult. That‚Äôs one of the things I really appreciated about our stay at @clubmedalpedhuez. Their packages are a relatively affordable way to go skiing. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIt can seem so overwhelming to go for a day of skiing, much less a ski vacation, sometimes I question whether it‚Äôs worth it. But at the end of the day, it‚Äôs experiences like these that we cherish more than any thing. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nHappy mini-moon, @rob.lea. Here‚Äôs to our first few months of marriage.",

I‚Äôm just over six months out and some days, it feels like I‚Äôm taking two steps forward one step back. It‚Äôs been a slow process and my knee still feels like it‚Äôs 70%. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIt gives me a ton of appreciation for the times in my life I‚Äôve been in peak fitness. And it makes skiing interesting again. I‚Äôm learning so many new ways to use my leg everyday. It excites and tires me. My brain is making new connections. My balance and proprioception are challenged. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nI‚Äôm working my way back up slowly and conservatively and taking it one day at a time. And constantly telling my muscles and knee how strong and awesome they are! ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nYour body hears what you say to it and your cells and tissue react.

It‚Äôs what truly makes me come alive. It‚Äôs instilled in me a fierce desire to not only protect these places where I play, but this planet that‚Äôs home to all of us.\n\nIt also comes with guilt. Guilt associated with the footprint my travels have that are unfortunately a consequence of doing what I love.\n\nIt‚Äôs no secret we live in an imperfect society and I, as is everyone, am an imperfect human. I am part of the problem. But I am also part of the solution. Which is why, despite this sometimes crippling guilt, I won‚Äôt hold myself back from speaking up and driving awareness and action on issues I care about.\n\nWith that said, I‚Äôm excited to share that @protectourwinters has a new carbon offset program. While, again, it‚Äôs not perfect, as in our carbon-based society it‚Äôs impossible to be, it is progress. And a great option I plan to embrace in my own travels going forward. Because what makes us come alive is exactly what the world needs right now.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nHit the link below or in my bio to learn more about POW‚Äôs program.\n\nhttps://carbon.protectourwinters.org/calculate\nPhoto @acpictures",

Its old-growth trees, some of which are 400-500 years old, play a key role in sequestering carbon emissions by absorbing 8% of all carbon captured by National Forest lands in our country.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThese same trees are currently threatened by a dangerous proposal that would remove their protections and open them up to logging. Clear-cut a forest like this, and all that carbon they‚Äôve been sequestering for hundreds of years will be released back into the atmosphere.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nNow, more than ever, we need to keep these forests and roadless areas untouched, as they are truly the lungs of the planet. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nNow is our chance to speak up for them. Please join me in sending your comments to the @u.s.forestservice via the link in my bio calling for their continued protection by no later than TOMORROW. Let‚Äôs not allow another one of our national treasures be destroyed by short-sided greed. \nPhoto: not the Tongass, but a beautiful forest in the Canadian Rockies. @wildernesssociety @outdooralliance #AnswerWithAction",

          "comment": "One of the best parts of my holiday season was skiing with my family, especially my nieces and nephews (ages 2-6). This year, I felt a deeper longing to spend time with my family. Maybe it was those cold, scary nights on Everest/Chomolungma that make me want to hold my loved ones a little closer now. Experiences like that change you. They put priorities into place. Whatever the motivation, I loved our days at the ski resort and I was especially stoked when I took the whole crew skiing uphill and towed the kids in the sled behind me.

We discussed¬†how¬†supporting certified B Corps¬†is an easy way¬†to be a more conscious consumer.¬†‚Å£ ‚Å£\nCertified B Corps are businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.¬†This is a certification that Gaia Herbs has achieved.¬†You can find a directory of B-Corps at¬†bcorporation.net, or look for the logo on packaging - it's a B with a circle around it.‚Å£ ‚Å£\nWe also discussed some ideas for gift giving:‚Å£\n* Give experiences rather than things (pictured here- a day out skiing with friends and family is the ultimate gift in my opinion)‚Å£\n* Give plant cuttings from succulents and¬†cacti.¬†‚Å£\n* Make donations instead of gifts.‚Å£\n* Consider giving gently used items.‚Å£\n* Give less but make it higher quality. Consider the life cycle of the product - pay more for recyclability and repairability.‚Å£\n* Shop local, shop women led and POC owned brands‚Å£ ‚Å£\nWhat are your tips?

It comes with a travel case that charges both the brush and a USB device. The AI technology recognizes brushing patterns to offer personalized feedback on the areas that require additional attention, so you can brush in the best way to improve your oral-health. It also helps you brush for the right amount of time, with the right amount of pressure, in the right areas of your mouth.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThis holiday season, consider giving the gift of oral-hygiene via the link in my stories.

I wanted to soak in every last moment of this sunset at Camp 2 on Everest/Chomolungma (25,000‚Äô/7620m), but my fingers could only handle a few moments of the cold before I had to zip up the tent and warm back up. Sharing that moment with my now husband, @rob.lea, was the greatest gift in the world. You‚Äôre officially off the hook for a Christmas present this year, Rob. \n#bigmtndreams #climbforequality",

Thank goodness we had LTE there so we could pull off this mismatched but cohesive bridesmaids dress look. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nPlanning my wedding was so much fun! It was something I had been dreaming of for so long. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIt happened at the perfect time in my life. It took me a long time to accept and love the part of myself that loves to wear dresses and twirl around in chiffon. It took me a long time to accept that I can be a feminist and want to be a bride and a wife. Gender equality is all about honoring the best parts of everyone. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nI love these strong, brave and beautiful women!

I‚Äôm just over six months out and some days, it feels like I‚Äôm taking two steps forward one step back. It‚Äôs been a slow process and my knee still feels like it‚Äôs 70%. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIt gives me a ton of appreciation for the times in my life I‚Äôve been in peak fitness. And it makes skiing interesting again. I‚Äôm learning so many new ways to use my leg everyday. It excites and tires me. My brain is making new connections. My balance and proprioception are challenged. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nI‚Äôm working my way back up slowly and conservatively and taking it one day at a time. And constantly telling my muscles and knee how strong and awesome they are! ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nYour body hears what you say to it and your cells and tissue react.

It‚Äôs what truly makes me come alive. It‚Äôs instilled in me a fierce desire to not only protect these places where I play, but this planet that‚Äôs home to all of us.\n\nIt also comes with guilt. Guilt associated with the footprint my travels have that are unfortunately a consequence of doing what I love.\n\nIt‚Äôs no secret we live in an imperfect society and I, as is everyone, am an imperfect human. I am part of the problem. But I am also part of the solution. Which is why, despite this sometimes crippling guilt, I won‚Äôt hold myself back from speaking up and driving awareness and action on issues I care about.\n\nWith that said, I‚Äôm excited to share that @protectourwinters has a new carbon offset program. While, again, it‚Äôs not perfect, as in our carbon-based society it‚Äôs impossible to be, it is progress. And a great option I plan to embrace in my own travels going forward. Because what makes us come alive is exactly what the world needs right now.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nHit the link below or in my bio to learn more about POW‚Äôs program.\n\nhttps://carbon.protectourwinters.org/calculate\nPhoto @acpictures",

It can be easy to forget about brushing properly when your priorities are elsewhere and you‚Äôre focused on getting out the door and on to the mountain. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThat‚Äôs why I am so excited about the new @OralB GENIUS X to use every day and on my ski trips and expeditions. It comes with a travel case that charges both the brush and a USB device. The AI technology recognizes brushing patterns to offer personalized feedback on the areas that require additional attention, so you can brush in the best way to improve your oral-health. It also helps you brush for the right amount of time, with the right amount of pressure, in the right areas of your mouth.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThis holiday season, consider giving the gift of oral-hygiene via the link in my stories. You can also grab this awesome new brush on sale now ahead of the holidays!‚Å£\n‚Å£\n#OralBHolidayDeals‚Å£ #ad",

I remember when I first learned about Seasonal Affective Depression, I felt a wave of relief. I finally had language to describe what I had been feeling. I also learned that skiing was a treatment. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nSkiing and mountaineering have become a way of coping with depression. It‚Äôs a way of finding light in the darkness of my mind. It‚Äôs a way to survive the dark winter months. I thought I‚Äôd share this today on the winter solstice. After today, every day will get a little bit brighter. ‚Å£happy winter solstice to all my friends in the Northern Hemisphere. I‚Äôm so grateful to have a space here where I can talk about this stuff.

I never had a new pair of skis until a sponsor gave them to me. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nI learned how to ski when I was a kiddo, but I never raced or skied competitively growing up.

That‚Äôs one of the things I really appreciated about our stay at @clubmedalpedhuez.

          "comment": "2019 was a big year. We bought a house. We started a foundation. I tore my ACL. I reached the highest point in the world. I had knee surgery. I crewed @rob.lea on his English Channel swim. I hiked up to the highest peak in the UK 6 weeks after knee surgery. We got married. I rode my bike almost a thousand miles with Rob and crewed him on his ride across America. I testified to the Senate about how climate change is affecting the mountains. I marched for climate. I shared my story with hundreds of people in real life in the many keynotes and talks I did. I took my nieces and nephews camping and taught them how to climb and ski.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nBut perhaps what I‚Äôm most proud of in 2019 is learning how to love myself. I know that sounds clich√©, but hear me out. I used to approach skiing and mountaineering as an escape and a form of self punishment. I would always try to go a little harder and push myself to hurt a little more.  It was like a drug, a way of punishing my body and escaping my inner demons.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIt taken me a long time to work through that and come to a place where I approach what I do from a place of self love. To be able to stop when it hurts, to rest when I need it. To say no to those things that don‚Äôt serve me. Where it‚Äôs not about disciplining my body  but it‚Äôs about passion and love, for the places I‚Äôm in, for my partners and for myself. Here‚Äôs to more of that in 2020. Whatever we do in 2020, let‚Äôs do it from a place of love.",

          "comment": "One of the best parts of my holiday season was skiing with my family, especially my nieces and nephews (ages 2-6). This year, I felt a deeper longing to spend time with my family. Maybe it was those cold, scary nights on Everest/Chomolungma that make me want to hold my loved ones a little closer now. Experiences like that change you. They put priorities into place. Whatever the motivation, I loved our days at the ski resort and I was especially stoked when I took the whole crew skiing uphill and towed the kids in the sled behind me. Here‚Äôs to more family outdoor adventures in 2020...\nPhoto: Stephen Gleich",

          "comment": "Today marks 7 months since I had ACL replacement surgery. To my fellow knee injury buddies, I thought I‚Äôd share some of what I‚Äôve learned in my recovery so far. ‚Å£Here are my top twelve:\n‚Å£\n1.  It‚Äôs ok to have moments of wallowing in self despair. Being depressed because you‚Äôre unable to do what you love is completely understandable. It takes time to find the silver lining with injuries. Or maybe you never find it. For those struggling, I see you. You‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs going to be ok.‚Å£ I‚Äôve found @headspace to be really useful during challenging times (unsponsored).\n2.  Focus on what you can do, not what you can‚Äôt.‚Å£\n3.  Remember all the ways it could be worse.‚Å£\n4.  If you‚Äôve torn your ACL, find a physical therapist that you love because you‚Äôve going to be spending a lot of time together. Cherish each day of having a personal trainer and have fun with it! Grateful for you @smmurnin!\n5.  Don‚Äôt compare yourself to your pre-injury state. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others. Focus on doing the best you can everyday. (still struggle with this, not just with knee stuff)‚Å£\n6.  Celebrate the little and big successes in your recovery.‚Å£\n7.  Injuries create space for new growth and opportunities to do things you wouldn‚Äôt expect. Enjoy the unexpected. ‚Å£\n8.  Stay connected to people by taking group fitness classes when you‚Äôre ready. Swim if you can‚Äôt weight bear (get a pull buoy so you just use your arms, not your legs). Also, follow @theaclclub.‚Å£\n9.  I found reformer Pilates to be an awesome way to strengthen, stretch and re-learn how to balance when I was injured. \n10.  Try dry needling, kinesio tape and other recovery tools like @ntrecovery legs.‚Å£\n11.  Try CBD for pain/discomfort and turmeric for swelling. For me, @gaiaherbs hemp products were a life-saver.‚Å£\n12.  Try to get a little bit of sunshine each day, even if you‚Äôre on crutches. For me, the vitamin D is imperative to my mood. \nI‚Äôd love to hear your tips! Share in the comments below! \n@keen #keenambassador",

Snag yourself some hiking sandals like Chacos! I can't tell you how many times I slipped and slide through some hot springs. LOL. The surface below the spring is a lot slicker than you might think! Hiking sandals will give you some traction and prevent slipping. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\n2. Drink Water - Believe it or not, if you choose to skip out on hydrating, you run the risk of heatstroke! Make sure you bring a reusable water bottle with you and hydrate as much as possible! Keep glass containers away from hot springs. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\n3. Test The Water - Ohhhhh lawdy. I swear, there were some hot springs in Idaho that I'm pretty sure would have singed my skin right off LMAO. Before getting into a spring, test the water! Doing so might prevent you from getting into a spring that's not that warm in the first place. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\n4. The Warmest Water Is Closest To The Source - It's usually pretty easy to spot the source of hot spring water. Sometimes folks lead it to a pool with a PVC pipe. Therefore, the closer you are to the source, the warmer the water will be!‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\n5. Save The Bath For Home - Hot Springs aren't a bathtub! Soaps (even the natural kind) can severely damage a spring and cause it to cool down over time. You also run the risk at smelling like sulfur/ farts, so just save the bath for when you get home lol. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nWant more tips and details about the best hot springs?‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nùóñùóµùó≤ùó∞ùó∏ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóπùó∂ùóªùó∏ ùó∂ùóª ùó∫ùòÜ ùóØùó∂ùóº! I've written up blogs about the best Idaho hot springs as well as some awesome hot springs you can enjoy in California! Give the blogs a read and start planning your next hot spring getaway!",

          "comment": "For the holiday gifting this year, I‚Äôve partnered with @REI! Before I get into all the good stuffüéÑ...‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nthere are some things you should know about Scott and me.‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nBelieve it or not, everything in our van is everything we own! We like living with less, which is actually what makes holiday gifting for us such a pain point for our familiesüòÇ. You see, in our apartment, we slowlllyyy became collectors, especially with outdoor gear. I‚Äôm talking multiple backpacks, jackets galore, mismatching trekking poles. Eventually, we finally decided enough was enough, donated everything we could, and replaced what we needed to. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nNow, a majority of our gear is made by companies doing some awesome things for the planet. Think products made from responsibly sourced materials, ethical supply chains, fair trade policies, etc. That‚Äôs because when we decided to live with just the essentials, we also decided that anything we do ‚Äúcollect‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt harm the planet. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nWhen considering what gifts to get outdoor lovers in your life, I highly recommend going eco-friendly! So many sustainable products out there are built to last and can be used for years to come. Plussss, Mother Nature will thank you! ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nYou can read my round-up of eco-friendly gifts in collab with @REI by clicking the link in my bio! My Eco-Friendly Gift Guide for Outdoor Lovers includes gifts for him, her, and under $50. AND starting today is @REI‚Äôs Shop Now, Be Done sale, which means you can save some money while you‚Äôre busy playing Santa. I‚Äôve also updated the guide to include some fantastic @REI classes you can gift and information about REI‚ÄôS Used Gear program that you can use for shopping too. Head to the link in my bio to check it out!üéÑüåé‚ú®",

I have visited Yosemite three times now, and two out of those three were for winter. Honestly, nothing beats the winter wonderland this park becomes in a matter of hours after some fresh snow!‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIf Yosemite NP isn't on your winter bucket list, it should be! *ùó¶ùóÆùòÉùó≤ ùòÅùóµùó∂ùòÄ ùóΩùóºùòÄùòÅ* for future trip planning because I'm about to tell you some things you can do in Yosemite this winter + tips for when you go!‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nùóßùóõùóúùó°ùóöùó¶ ùóßùó¢ ùóóùó¢‚†Ä\n‚ë†ùó™ùóÆùòÅùó∞ùóµ ùó¶ùòÇùóªùóøùó∂ùòÄùó≤ ùóîùòÅ ùóßùòÇùóªùóªùó≤ùóπ ùó©ùó∂ùó≤ùòÑ!üåû‚†Ä\nYes, Tunnel View is great in the summer, but it's even better in winter (pictured above)! Early in the morning, there is sometimes low hanging fog that looks like cotton balls spread out amongst the trees. It makes for some great photos!‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚ë°ùó¶ùó∏ùó∂ ùóßùóº ùóöùóπùóÆùó∞ùó∂ùó≤ùóø ùó£ùóºùó∂ùóªùòÅ!üéø‚†Ä\nWhile the road to Glacier Point will close, you can still rent skis and make your way up there!

Keep this in mind for your trip since there will be road closures!‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚ë°The weather in Yosemite Valley can range from 53¬∞F (12¬∞C) to 28¬∞F (-2¬∞C). Make sure you wear layers!‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚ë¢Wear sunscreen! It seems counter-intuitive, but snow can reflect a ton of light right back at you and bake your face with the white-hot intensity of a thousand suns.

Before I get into all the good stuffüéÑ...‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nthere are some things you should know about Scott and me.‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nBelieve it or not, everything in our van is everything we own! We like living with less, which is actually what makes holiday gifting for us such a pain point for our familiesüòÇ. You see, in our apartment, we slowlllyyy became collectors, especially with outdoor gear. I‚Äôm talking multiple backpacks, jackets galore, mismatching trekking poles. Eventually, we finally decided enough was enough, donated everything we could, and replaced what we needed to. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nNow, a majority of our gear is made by companies doing some awesome things for the planet. Think products made from responsibly sourced materials, ethical supply chains, fair trade policies, etc. That‚Äôs because when we decided to live with just the essentials, we also decided that anything we do ‚Äúcollect‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt harm the planet. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nWhen considering what gifts to get outdoor lovers in your life, I highly recommend going eco-friendly! So many sustainable products out there are built to last and can be used for years to come. Plussss, Mother Nature will thank you! ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nYou can read my round-up of eco-friendly gifts in collab with @REI by clicking the link in my bio! My Eco-Friendly Gift Guide for Outdoor Lovers includes gifts for him, her, and under $50. AND starting today is @REI‚Äôs Shop Now, Be Done sale, which means you can save some money while you‚Äôre busy playing Santa. I‚Äôve also updated the guide to include some fantastic @REI classes you can gift and information about REI‚ÄôS Used Gear program that you can use for shopping too.

Snag yourself some hiking sandals like Chacos! I can't tell you how many times I slipped and slide through some hot springs. LOL. The surface below the spring is a lot slicker than you might think! Hiking sandals will give you some traction and prevent slipping. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\n2. Drink Water - Believe it or not, if you choose to skip out on hydrating, you run the risk of heatstroke! Make sure you bring a reusable water bottle with you and hydrate as much as possible! Keep glass containers away from hot springs. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\n3. Test The Water - Ohhhhh lawdy. I swear, there were some hot springs in Idaho that I'm pretty sure would have singed my skin right off LMAO. Before getting into a spring, test the water! Doing so might prevent you from getting into a spring that's not that warm in the first place. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\n4. The Warmest Water Is Closest To The Source - It's usually pretty easy to spot the source of hot spring water. Sometimes folks lead it to a pool with a PVC pipe. Therefore, the closer you are to the source, the warmer the water will be!‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\n5. Save The Bath For Home - Hot Springs aren't a bathtub! Soaps (even the natural kind) can severely damage a spring and cause it to cool down over time. You also run the risk at smelling like sulfur/ farts, so just save the bath for when you get home lol. ‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚Å†‚†Ä\nWant more tips and details about the best hot springs?‚Å†‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nùóñùóµùó≤ùó∞ùó∏ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóπùó∂ùóªùó∏ ùó∂ùóª ùó∫ùòÜ ùóØùó∂ùóº!

I‚Äôm all about hard work, but I don‚Äôt necessarily believe working longer means you‚Äôre working smarter or ‚Äúharder‚Äù. And after reflecting on my 2019, I didn‚Äôt realize how much working longer hours kept me from enjoying myself at times. BUT I‚Äôm other news, 2019 was a great year. Here‚Äôs a quick run down of what it looked like for me:‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚ú®Scott and I moved into a campervan! We got rid of all our belongings and left our apartment in April‚†Ä\n‚ú®Leaving from Arizona, we traveled to Utah, California, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, just about all of New England, North & South Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio, then back to AZ‚†Ä\n‚ú®I exceeded the financial goals I had for my business which was a major win‚†Ä\n‚ú®I forced myself to start learning video, something I‚Äôm looking forward to in 2020‚†Ä\n‚ú®I was able to work with 90% of my dream clients on projects I‚Äôm proud of‚†Ä\n‚ú®I was able to get my acne under control (something I‚Äôve struggled with in the past) and learned how to maintain a healthy diet/ exercise routine while traveling (something else I put off most times)‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nAll in all, it was a great year!

I don‚Äôt mean to mislead anyone on here, but I do hope that the photos I post and the stories I tell do make you happy & feel good. Right now though, I‚Äôm a bit down. A combination of an insane travel month last month that ended in me getting violently ill, overworking myself, overpromising things, and simply not enough down & me time. Mexico was more taxing on me than I think I even realize, but it sparked my desire to help more. Volunteering my time when and where I can is incredibly rewarding. It also means that I am giving away more time from myself and my family that I too, desperately need. Finding a balance is something I‚Äôve always struggled with... leaning too far any direction. I‚Äôm learning though. Learning to ask for help when I need it, learning when to say no.. and yes, learning to stand up for myself and speak my truth. Staying strong when life beats you down is incredibly difficult, and while stuff has been much harder than it is right now, it doesn‚Äôt matter or compare. Every little bit of hurt is still hurt now matter how big of a deal it may look or feel to someone else. Right now, I‚Äôm giving myself a break and saying no to most things... with the exception of time with my dogs. I hope you all take care of yourself this way too, put yourself first, always. ü§ç",

Those essentials include many cans of beer, whiskey, a fishing rod, face masks, camera, lenses, and lots of food, deserts + snacks.

I‚Äôm so happy with all the changes, even if they hurt like hell and I didn‚Äôt like them at the time. I‚Äôm thankful for it all.

          "comment": "As Rio gets older, our adventure dates look a little different. He has pretty severe arthritis, so long trips on foot aren‚Äôt really an option for him anymore, so we‚Äôve started doing a lot more on the road and finding fun cabins to stay at. We can go on micro adventures, snuggle beside a fire, play games + eat good food. It‚Äôs essentially the same as it was before, something we all love to do together + but this is easier for him. For us, it‚Äôs simply about being together... at home, the outdoors or a cabin in a new place. \n@Backcountry believes anyone is capable of enjoying outdoor experiences, big or small, near or far ‚Äî to inspire people to have their best experiences outside recreating and enjoying open spaces, trying new adventurous activities, and really connecting with nature in a positive and meaningful way. \nI am partnering with @backcountry to keep encouraging you to get outside and find your backcountry, wherever that may be.

          "comment": "I‚Äôve been meaning to write about this for sometime now, but just getting around to it... Finances! I started off 2019 in an absolute mess and a really bad spot... a bad financial place that I had been stuck in for about 3 years. With the guidance and some suggestions from my dad (thanks dad!), I can tell you right now that I‚Äôve never been more at peace and felt as stable before. While everyones journey to getting to a place where you‚Äôre feeling good is going to be different, I wanted to share some simple tips I learned and implemented that can help you too! \nThe very first thing you can do today is to write out... yes, on pen and paper... your income versus expenses. Your income number should be the amount you get in your bank account after taxes AND after setting aside at least 10% of that paycheck into a retirement account. I set aside 18% because it‚Äôs easier to be aggressive now when I still have time on my side... not when I‚Äôm 50. Also, compound interest folks. For your expenses column, list it all.. everything you are spending money on. My expenses column also include a personal emergency savings account and a dog emergency savings account. When you compare the two columns... the goal here is to have your income still higher than your expenses. If it‚Äôs not... time to do some adjusting. Where can you cut out expenses? Food, yard maintenance, clothing? The only way to get out of the negative is to tighten those budgets up! For me... for many, many months, I ate meals of pasta, rice, cereal, etc. I know it‚Äôs not the ‚Äòhealthiest‚Äô, but I was able to cut down on grocery bills tremendously just by altering a few meals. \nFinances don‚Äôt have to be scary and overwhelming... and certainly doesn‚Äôt require that trigonometry class you had to take in high school. You can do this. Looking forward to continuing to work towards a more financially healthy future in this new year, as I will be sitting down today and making more goals.",

          "comment": "Spending a few days in the Sun Valley area with my sister right now! We‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs important to get away, just the two of us, every year, even for just for a few days. \nToday was so much fun! We hit the slopes, and while it wasn‚Äôt totally sunny, the groomers were ripping, the air was cold & crisp and we had a blast! We followed up our chilly mountain time with some yoga & hot tubbing to warm up. \nToday, i‚Äôm grateful for the many gorgeous places, like Sun Valley, where we can get outside to play. \n@TravelMindset #seeksunvalley",

          "comment": "Our final day in Sun Valley left us with a full heart and big grins. We headed into the Sawtooth National Forest via snowmobile with @sunvalleyguides, then we walked uphill to find some turns through this burn area. There‚Äôs something so beautiful and peaceful about skiing in a burn... maybe it‚Äôs the heavy contrasted environment, the creaking of the trees, the views, or the way the wind whips through and blows snow across the surface. It‚Äôs probably all of that and more. What a great way to end our trip + looking forward to coming back for more. Thank you @travelmindset for hosting this incredibly special trip for my sister and I ü§ç #seeksunvalley",

Kettle Brand turns their spent oil into biodiesel and run their company car on it, and they integrate renewable energy into their operations, including the generation & use of solar & wind energy as well as water reclamation systems. Kettle Brand also is restoring the native landscape around their facilities, committing to protecting pollinators, and give more than 55,000 pounds of potatoes to hunger relief agencies & and chips to schools and local organizations.

I don‚Äôt mean to mislead anyone on here, but I do hope that the photos I post and the stories I tell do make you happy & feel good. Right now though, I‚Äôm a bit down. A combination of an insane travel month last month that ended in me getting violently ill, overworking myself, overpromising things, and simply not enough down & me time. Mexico was more taxing on me than I think I even realize, but it sparked my desire to help more. Volunteering my time when and where I can is incredibly rewarding. It also means that I am giving away more time from myself and my family that I too, desperately need. Finding a balance is something I‚Äôve always struggled with... leaning too far any direction. I‚Äôm learning though. Learning to ask for help when I need it, learning when to say no.. and yes, learning to stand up for myself and speak my truth. Staying strong when life beats you down is incredibly difficult, and while stuff has been much harder than it is right now, it doesn‚Äôt matter or compare. Every little bit of hurt is still hurt now matter how big of a deal it may look or feel to someone else. Right now, I‚Äôm giving myself a break and saying no to most things... with the exception of time with my dogs. I hope you all take care of yourself this way too, put yourself first, always. ü§ç",

          "comment": "As Rio gets older, our adventure dates look a little different. He has pretty severe arthritis, so long trips on foot aren‚Äôt really an option for him anymore, so we‚Äôve started doing a lot more on the road and finding fun cabins to stay at. We can go on micro adventures, snuggle beside a fire, play games + eat good food. It‚Äôs essentially the same as it was before, something we all love to do together + but this is easier for him. For us, it‚Äôs simply about being together... at home, the outdoors or a cabin in a new place. \n@Backcountry believes anyone is capable of enjoying outdoor experiences, big or small, near or far ‚Äî to inspire people to have their best experiences outside recreating and enjoying open spaces, trying new adventurous activities, and really connecting with nature in a positive and meaningful way. \nI am partnering with @backcountry to keep encouraging you to get outside and find your backcountry, wherever that may be.

We headed into the Sawtooth National Forest via snowmobile with @sunvalleyguides, then we walked uphill to find some turns through this burn area. There‚Äôs something so beautiful and peaceful about skiing in a burn... maybe it‚Äôs the heavy contrasted environment, the creaking of the trees, the views, or the way the wind whips through and blows snow across the surface. It‚Äôs probably all of that and more. What a great way to end our trip + looking forward to coming back for more.

          "comment": "A few weeks ago a friend of mine made a comment about how my social media was a decent representation of who I am but was lacking depth. I‚Äôve always been sensitive to the fact that it‚Äôs easy to be perceived as vain on an app like this and that sharing too much personal information can be kinda scary. I guess I maybe thought that people just like to see nice photos and don‚Äôt really care to know too much about the person behind the screen. After our chat I figured for anyone who might not know me personally and maybe does want a little more insight on that blonde girl who pops up on their Instagram feed from time to time I‚Äôd share a few things about myself.\n1. I‚Äôm 25 years old\n2. I live in Whistler, BC but I‚Äôm from Ottawa, ON\n3. I love to ski, workout, bike, surf and hike\n4. I‚Äôm currently self employed and make most of my income from social media but also do some consulting work and the odd modelling job \n5. I hate the word ‚Äòslice‚Äô, arrogant people and the sound of airplane toilets \n6. I‚Äôm extremely afraid of snakes and heights\n7. My favorite thing to eat is a taco and my favorite thing to drink is a passionfruit margarita\n8. I have exceptionally ugly feet\n9. I‚Äôm one of five kids \n10. My pet peeves are when people use plastic straws or when people don‚Äôt say thank you\n11. A few of my life goals are to become a personal trainer, buy myself a house, live in a different country, go up in a hot air balloon, speak three languages and own a golden retriever puppy\n12. My favorite book is The Alchemist, my favorite movie is ‚ÄòStand By Me‚Äô and my favorite song is Skinny Love by Bon Iver \n13. I love getting mail more than just about anything\n14. I also love road trips, sunshine, chocolate covered almonds and people who make me laugh\n15. Besides Canada - Mexico, Morocco and Austria are my favorite places in the world\n16. I like buying my clothes from thrift stores cause that way I don‚Äôt have the same things as anyone else\n17. My middle name is Quinte..\n18. I can touch my tongue to my nose and I sometimes I clap when a plane lands smoothly.\n‚Ä¢\nIf you know me and can think of anything else feel free to comment below but I think I covered just about everything üí´",

I did a lot of things on my own, made some wonderful friends, got robbed a couple of times, spent more time at home, spent more time with my family, ate a lot of food, slept in a few airports, decided to start drinking coffee, decided to stop drinking coffee, learned when to say no, worked hard, travelled far, stood on top of a few mountains, swam in a few oceans, laughed a bunch and through it all got to know myself one heck of a whole lot better.

          "comment": "I decided to come to Mexico for an open ended period of time this fall. I‚Äôve done my fair share of travelling throughout the last few years- ticking a lot of places off the map but rarely ever allowing myself to slow down long enough to just be somewhere. \nThis country is really special to me and my goal this time around was to connect with it a little deeper, explore some new places and make sure that my time here wasn‚Äôt some big rush. To appreciate the art, listen to the music, go to the museums, eat the food, understand the architecture, embrace the history, walk the streets, surf the waves, visit the big cities, lay on the beaches, and make friends with the people. To be a traveller, not a tourist. A few months ago I signed up for the @cibc Aventura Visa Infinite Card - the extra points that I earned when signing up for the card were put towards getting down here and travelling in and around this big and beautifully diverse country. They were put towards leaving the beach to go explore a city (something I wouldn‚Äôt normally do) - to finding the most beautiful hot springs and the best tacos- to realizing Mexico does in fact have some mountains and that my new favourite dessert is a churro. They were put towards giving this place a little more depth and meaning for me üíõ‚Ä®‚Ä¢‚Ä®Click the link in my bio to sign up for the @CIBC Aventura Visa Infinite Card today and earn 35,000 points - that‚Äôs up to $800 towards your next flight. Here‚Äôs hoping you‚Äôll use them to go and explore somewhere new or maybe to connect deeper with somewhere you‚Äôve already been like I have these past few weeks with Mexico üí´#CIBCAventura #sponsored",

          "comment": "‚ÄòTo invest in travel is to invest in yourself‚Äô ü¶ã I‚Äôve made a solid point over the past few years to invest a lot of my time, energy and money into seeing the world. I‚Äôve always thought of it as the best way to get to know myself and grow as a human being. To figure out the places that make me the happiest, the people who make me better and the activities that make me feel the most alive by putting myself in  new and unfamiliar environments. But travelling, especially as a young female, can be a bit intimidating at times. I‚Äôve learnt over the past few years that having a solid credit card with perks that fit my lifestyle has eliminated a lot of extra stress while out on the road. It's made it easier to track my spending, it's protected me from theft and it‚Äôs helped me enjoy my time out exploring the world just a little bit more.\n‚Ä¢\nI discovered the @cibc Aventura Visa Infinite Card about a year ago. The points I earned from applying for the card and using it frequently over the last 12 months helped me get down to Mexico this fall, relax, and really give surfing a go. Some of the card‚Äôs other perks include 4 complimentary airport lounge visits per year, mobile device insurance and I even got a rebate on my Nexus Application Fee. Not to mention the ‚Äòhotel burglary insurance‚Äô attached to the card helped me get through a pretty tough time when I got robbed down in Costa Rica 6 months ago.\n‚Ä¢\nSo if you enjoy seeing the world as much as I do, and are looking for a new travel card - invest in yourself by clicking the link in my bio and signing up for the CIBC Aventura Visa Infinite Card today üí´ Happy travels #CIBCAventura #sponsored",

Another thing I promised myself this year was to start trying new things regardless of how bad I just might be at them in the beginning. I‚Äôve always had a hard time being the worst at something which in hindsight has probably robbed me from a lot of beautiful experiences. With that said- one of the best decisions I made in 2019 was to finally get myself a mountain bike. To give myself a gift that allows me to experience and explore my beautiful home with fresh eyes and have something new to work on and improve at.  Big thanks my friends @backcountry for helping me pick out a bike, for getting me set up with all of the proper equipment and for always, always, always encouraging me to get outside and try new things üíõ\n‚Ä¢\nIf you‚Äôre interested in trying a new sport in the new year, need some last minute Christmas gifts or want to avoid going to the mall this holiday season use the code HAYDEN15 for 15% off + 2 day free shipping off your first order on @Backcountry.com. *exclusions apply* Happy Holidays üí´  #sponsored #findyourbackcountry",

          "comment": "I decided to come to Mexico for an open ended period of time this fall. I‚Äôve done my fair share of travelling throughout the last few years- ticking a lot of places off the map but rarely ever allowing myself to slow down long enough to just be somewhere. \nThis country is really special to me and my goal this time around was to connect with it a little deeper, explore some new places and make sure that my time here wasn‚Äôt some big rush. To appreciate the art, listen to the music, go to the museums, eat the food, understand the architecture, embrace the history, walk the streets, surf the waves, visit the big cities, lay on the beaches, and make friends with the people. To be a traveller, not a tourist. A few months ago I signed up for the @cibc Aventura Visa Infinite Card - the extra points that I earned when signing up for the card were put towards getting down here and travelling in and around this big and beautifully diverse country. They were put towards leaving the beach to go explore a city (something I wouldn‚Äôt normally do) - to finding the most beautiful hot springs and the best tacos- to realizing Mexico does in fact have some mountains and that my new favourite dessert is a churro. They were put towards giving this place a little more depth and meaning for me üíõ‚Ä®‚Ä¢‚Ä®Click the link in my bio to sign up for the @CIBC Aventura Visa Infinite Card today and earn 35,000 points - that‚Äôs up to $800 towards your next flight. Here‚Äôs hoping you‚Äôll use them to go and explore somewhere new or maybe to connect deeper with somewhere you‚Äôve already been like I have these past few weeks with Mexico üí´#CIBCAventura #sponsored",

          "comment": "A few weeks ago a friend of mine made a comment about how my social media was a decent representation of who I am but was lacking depth. I‚Äôve always been sensitive to the fact that it‚Äôs easy to be perceived as vain on an app like this and that sharing too much personal information can be kinda scary. I guess I maybe thought that people just like to see nice photos and don‚Äôt really care to know too much about the person behind the screen. After our chat I figured for anyone who might not know me personally and maybe does want a little more insight on that blonde girl who pops up on their Instagram feed from time to time I‚Äôd share a few things about myself.\n1. I‚Äôm 25 years old\n2. I live in Whistler, BC but I‚Äôm from Ottawa, ON\n3. I love to ski, workout, bike, surf and hike\n4. I‚Äôm currently self employed and make most of my income from social media but also do some consulting work and the odd modelling job \n5. I hate the word ‚Äòslice‚Äô, arrogant people and the sound of airplane toilets \n6. I‚Äôm extremely afraid of snakes and heights\n7. My favorite thing to eat is a taco and my favorite thing to drink is a passionfruit margarita\n8. I have exceptionally ugly feet\n9. I‚Äôm one of five kids \n10. My pet peeves are when people use plastic straws or when people don‚Äôt say thank you\n11. A few of my life goals are to become a personal trainer, buy myself a house, live in a different country, go up in a hot air balloon, speak three languages and own a golden retriever puppy\n12. My favorite book is The Alchemist, my favorite movie is ‚ÄòStand By Me‚Äô and my favorite song is Skinny Love by Bon Iver \n13. I love getting mail more than just about anything\n14. I also love road trips, sunshine, chocolate covered almonds and people who make me laugh\n15. Besides Canada - Mexico, Morocco and Austria are my favorite places in the world\n16. I like buying my clothes from thrift stores cause that way I don‚Äôt have the same things as anyone else\n17. My middle name is Quinte..\n18. I can touch my tongue to my nose and I sometimes I clap when a plane lands smoothly.\n‚Ä¢\nIf you know me and can think of anything else feel free to comment below but I think I covered just about everything üí´",

          "comment": "I made a promise to myself this year that I would slow down and spend more time at home. Being in a mountain town during the slow season can drive people a little stir crazy. This fall I decided to stay home for a good portion of it but also made a pact that I wasn‚Äôt going to be one of those people. I tried to fill my days with things that would keep me busy and active before the snow started to fall. Another thing I promised myself this year was to start trying new things regardless of how bad I just might be at them in the beginning. I‚Äôve always had a hard time being the worst at something which in hindsight has probably robbed me from a lot of beautiful experiences. With that said- one of the best decisions I made in 2019 was to finally get myself a mountain bike. To give myself a gift that allows me to experience and explore my beautiful home with fresh eyes and have something new to work on and improve at.  Big thanks my friends @backcountry for helping me pick out a bike, for getting me set up with all of the proper equipment and for always, always, always encouraging me to get outside and try new things üíõ\n‚Ä¢\nIf you‚Äôre interested in trying a new sport in the new year, need some last minute Christmas gifts or want to avoid going to the mall this holiday season use the code HAYDEN15 for 15% off + 2 day free shipping off your first order on @Backcountry.com. *exclusions apply* Happy Holidays üí´  #sponsored #findyourbackcountry",

          "comment": "‚ÄòTo invest in travel is to invest in yourself‚Äô ü¶ã I‚Äôve made a solid point over the past few years to invest a lot of my time, energy and money into seeing the world. I‚Äôve always thought of it as the best way to get to know myself and grow as a human being. To figure out the places that make me the happiest, the people who make me better and the activities that make me feel the most alive by putting myself in  new and unfamiliar environments. But travelling, especially as a young female, can be a bit intimidating at times. I‚Äôve learnt over the past few years that having a solid credit card with perks that fit my lifestyle has eliminated a lot of extra stress while out on the road. It's made it easier to track my spending, it's protected me from theft and it‚Äôs helped me enjoy my time out exploring the world just a little bit more.\n‚Ä¢\nI discovered the @cibc Aventura Visa Infinite Card about a year ago. The points I earned from applying for the card and using it frequently over the last 12 months helped me get down to Mexico this fall, relax, and really give surfing a go. Some of the card‚Äôs other perks include 4 complimentary airport lounge visits per year, mobile device insurance and I even got a rebate on my Nexus Application Fee. Not to mention the ‚Äòhotel burglary insurance‚Äô attached to the card helped me get through a pretty tough time when I got robbed down in Costa Rica 6 months ago.\n‚Ä¢\nSo if you enjoy seeing the world as much as I do, and are looking for a new travel card - invest in yourself by clicking the link in my bio and signing up for the CIBC Aventura Visa Infinite Card today üí´ Happy travels #CIBCAventura #sponsored",

In 2017, sitting at my desk at my day job, I stumbled onto a Chinese tourism website for the province of Guizhou that looked like it was made in 1995, with tiny pixelated thumbnail images of some of the most insane landscapes I had never seen before. Right there and then, I knew I needed to find a way there someday. \nFast forward to this August and, although it was my biggest travel challenge yet to navigate China, I was finally there and getting to take the photos I‚Äôd had in my head for so long. When we arrived at this Bavarian-looking castle (discovered via a deep Pinterest search session), I had only ever seen photos from the front, so I was surprised to discover these insane mountains were behind it too.\n\nWe were exploring around the castle when I realized the sun was dipping beneath the peaks, so I literally sprinted to a spot I could launch the drone from before all the light was gone. When I saw these light rays on my screen, I almost cried from relief that all the travel difficulties and money I‚Äôd thrown into this trip were paying off. An image several years in the making.",

Every spot you want to see is hours away from each other, and almost all require hikes in the dark before sunrise, so we pulled several all nighters that week.\n\nOn our last morning of this insane schedule, we did a three hour drive starting at 3am in order to make it to this waterfall for sunrise. When we got to the top of the falls, I sent the drone up and realized just how worth it the send was. Not only was I able to capture the low hanging fog before it burned off for the day, but the volcano in the distance was glowing slightly pink, kind of like you‚Äôd see alpenglow in the mountains.\n\nI‚Äôve found that the trips that push me the hardest mentally and physically usually end up not only being the most memorable, but produce my best work. It‚Äôs Type 2 kind of fun, but this photo and particular trip were definitely a testament to that.",

I was hoping for a shot with camels in the background, and luckily this curious camel decided to walk right up to us. The scarf I‚Äôm wearing is called a Keffiyeh, which Jordanian desert nomads wear to protect their head from the sun and their face from sand (they happily tied it on for me). When I saw the preview of this image in the back of @mikesugianto‚Äôs camera, I was beyond stoked we managed to capture all these unique local elements in a single photo and in golden light. I knew immediately it would be my favorite shot from the whole trip.",

Finding proper color is actually harder than it sounds...you need near perfect timing, which really means being willing to drive hours at a moments notice to anywhere peak color might be starting.\n‚Ä¢\nMe and @earthtoraymond spent two weeks camping, hiking and shooting, but this shot was actually the very first we took on the trip. I flew into New York straight from a gig in the Caribbean, then we drove 7 hours to northern New Hampshire where I thought fall colors might be starting to turn, slept in the car a couple hours, and hiked up to this point for sunrise. When we got up there, it was completely socked in by fog and we thought it was a total bust. But 20 minutes later it opened up and we saw this brilliant view for the first time. After a first morning this crazy, I knew we were in for a good trip.",

          "comment": "The last image in my 2019 countdown...my favorite photo of the year!\n\nPhoto 1: Falling Fire\n\nI‚Äôve done a Yosemite winter trip every year for the past five years, and this image is almost that long in the making. It was on one of those first trips, sitting in the lodge, that I heard about this natural phenomenon called firefall. For just two weeks in February, the sunset lines up perfectly with Horsetail Falls, lighting it up so that it literally looks like a waterfall made of fire. \nHowever, in order for this to happen, conditions have to be absolutely perfect. This means no clouds, which is pretty rare in February, and the right amount of melting snowpack for the waterfall to be flowing. Aka if you want to see this thing you gotta get really lucky. \nI first saw it in 2017, when we practically stumbled onto it happening. I didn‚Äôt have the proper camera gear to shoot it well, but I was completely in awe watching it happen, the craziest optical illusion I‚Äôve ever seen. 2018 comes around and I‚Äôm determined to shoot it this time, but there‚Äôs a drought which means no snow and therefore no waterfall.\n\nThis year, I knew it had to be my year. I went to the park for five days and figured if I tried every single night, eventually I‚Äôd get good conditions for it. On our third night, all the elements lined up perfectly. Fresh snowfall from the day prior was getting blown off the cliff by gusts of wind, illuminating like flames dancing through the air. Everyone watching it happen was saying it was the best firefall conditions in a decade. \nI‚Äôm standing there with my tripod surrounded by other photographers, freaking out it‚Äôs so beautiful, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a bird was about to fly into frame. Hit the shutter a few times hoping for the best and managed to capture it in the shot too. Between stubborn determination and a whole lot of luck, this shot become one of the highlights of my entire photography career so far.",

I was hoping for a shot with camels in the background, and luckily this curious camel decided to walk right up to us. The scarf I‚Äôm wearing is called a Keffiyeh, which Jordanian desert nomads wear to protect their head from the sun and their face from sand (they happily tied it on for me). When I saw the preview of this image in the back of @mikesugianto‚Äôs camera, I was beyond stoked we managed to capture all these unique local elements in a single photo and in golden light. I knew immediately it would be my favorite shot from the whole trip.",

Every spot you want to see is hours away from each other, and almost all require hikes in the dark before sunrise, so we pulled several all nighters that week.\n\nOn our last morning of this insane schedule, we did a three hour drive starting at 3am in order to make it to this waterfall for sunrise. When we got to the top of the falls, I sent the drone up and realized just how worth it the send was. Not only was I able to capture the low hanging fog before it burned off for the day, but the volcano in the distance was glowing slightly pink, kind of like you‚Äôd see alpenglow in the mountains.\n\nI‚Äôve found that the trips that push me the hardest mentally and physically usually end up not only being the most memorable, but produce my best work. It‚Äôs Type 2 kind of fun, but this photo and particular trip were definitely a testament to that.",

Finding proper color is actually harder than it sounds...you need near perfect timing, which really means being willing to drive hours at a moments notice to anywhere peak color might be starting.\n‚Ä¢\nMe and @earthtoraymond spent two weeks camping, hiking and shooting, but this shot was actually the very first we took on the trip. I flew into New York straight from a gig in the Caribbean, then we drove 7 hours to northern New Hampshire where I thought fall colors might be starting to turn, slept in the car a couple hours, and hiked up to this point for sunrise. When we got up there, it was completely socked in by fog and we thought it was a total bust. But 20 minutes later it opened up and we saw this brilliant view for the first time. After a first morning this crazy, I knew we were in for a good trip.",

In 2017, sitting at my desk at my day job, I stumbled onto a Chinese tourism website for the province of Guizhou that looked like it was made in 1995, with tiny pixelated thumbnail images of some of the most insane landscapes I had never seen before. Right there and then, I knew I needed to find a way there someday. \nFast forward to this August and, although it was my biggest travel challenge yet to navigate China, I was finally there and getting to take the photos I‚Äôd had in my head for so long. When we arrived at this Bavarian-looking castle (discovered via a deep Pinterest search session), I had only ever seen photos from the front, so I was surprised to discover these insane mountains were behind it too.\n\nWe were exploring around the castle when I realized the sun was dipping beneath the peaks, so I literally sprinted to a spot I could launch the drone from before all the light was gone. When I saw these light rays on my screen, I almost cried from relief that all the travel difficulties and money I‚Äôd thrown into this trip were paying off. An image several years in the making.",

          "comment": "The last image in my 2019 countdown...my favorite photo of the year!\n\nPhoto 1: Falling Fire\n\nI‚Äôve done a Yosemite winter trip every year for the past five years, and this image is almost that long in the making. It was on one of those first trips, sitting in the lodge, that I heard about this natural phenomenon called firefall. For just two weeks in February, the sunset lines up perfectly with Horsetail Falls, lighting it up so that it literally looks like a waterfall made of fire. \nHowever, in order for this to happen, conditions have to be absolutely perfect. This means no clouds, which is pretty rare in February, and the right amount of melting snowpack for the waterfall to be flowing. Aka if you want to see this thing you gotta get really lucky. \nI first saw it in 2017, when we practically stumbled onto it happening. I didn‚Äôt have the proper camera gear to shoot it well, but I was completely in awe watching it happen, the craziest optical illusion I‚Äôve ever seen. 2018 comes around and I‚Äôm determined to shoot it this time, but there‚Äôs a drought which means no snow and therefore no waterfall.\n\nThis year, I knew it had to be my year. I went to the park for five days and figured if I tried every single night, eventually I‚Äôd get good conditions for it. On our third night, all the elements lined up perfectly. Fresh snowfall from the day prior was getting blown off the cliff by gusts of wind, illuminating like flames dancing through the air. Everyone watching it happen was saying it was the best firefall conditions in a decade. \nI‚Äôm standing there with my tripod surrounded by other photographers, freaking out it‚Äôs so beautiful, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a bird was about to fly into frame. Hit the shutter a few times hoping for the best and managed to capture it in the shot too. Between stubborn determination and a whole lot of luck, this shot become one of the highlights of my entire photography career so far.",

Immediately as I crossed over the border, clouds and fog engulfed the entire sky. I know losing sunshine would probably bum a lot of people out, but I just smiled. Because even though I moved awhile ago now, it was the very first time that heading to the PNW truly felt like I was going home.",

It's a great characteristics but everything good comes with something challenging. I'm bad at slowing down, do things without purpose or a goal. A constant aim for something greater, which often results in that I forget to enjoy what I have. To be satisfied and happy for what I've accomplished. I've worked a lot with this the past years, to stop, breath, look, do thing for pure fun and cherish myself. So this is a reminder to you guys out there, look at where you are, enjoy the ride and once in a while, stop for appreciation.",

          "comment": "I've spent countless hours at sea. During the summers with my family we often took our boat to a remote island, to go for long swims and watch the seals sunbathing. Dad used to bring me out in the waves when windsurfing or rescue me when I was too tired. The ocean is such an essential aspect of my life and could never see myself spending too much time away from it.  A few weeks back, I got the opportunity to join @sjofartsverket for a day at sea to experience how they work. We took the pilot boat to look at the ships, I learned about the education they do and how they jump (!!) from the boat to the ship to make the route to land as safely as possible. Ships were massive I tell you. Cool to get out from my own life bubble and see something entirely different for a day. Have a look in my stories to see more. #samarbete #sverigesvackrastearbetsplats",

          "comment": "I've spent countless hours at sea. During the summers with my family we often took our boat to a remote island, to go for long swims and watch the seals sunbathing. Dad used to bring me out in the waves when windsurfing or rescue me when I was too tired. The ocean is such an essential aspect of my life and could never see myself spending too much time away from it.  A few weeks back, I got the opportunity to join @sjofartsverket for a day at sea to experience how they work. We took the pilot boat to look at the ships, I learned about the education they do and how they jump (!!) from the boat to the ship to make the route to land as safely as possible. Ships were massive I tell you. Cool to get out from my own life bubble and see something entirely different for a day. Have a look in my stories to see more. #samarbete #sverigesvackrastearbetsplats",

After my first attempt of setting up my tripod only for it to be instantly knocked over, I thought I outsmarted the elements by strapping my backpack to it and adding rocks. Only problem is - I‚Äôm on a volcano surrounded by nothing but pumice, which weighs NOTHING! So yeah, had to pack the tripod away, so just a good old fashion cheesin at the camera had to do. Hiking around Pico Viejo was surreal. I was in a completely different world. It was cold, windy, with snow capped peaks surrounded by red moonscape and sparse canary pine. I honestly forgot I was on a tropical island. It‚Äôs fascinating being in a place that‚Äôs filled with lush warm beaches and water, yet holds Spain‚Äôs tallest mountain.

Bringing the crew together to not only continue our backcountry education and expanding the range of gear, but to cultivate the bonds we have between each other. It‚Äôs one thing to have a sponsored freeski team, it‚Äôs another to have a freeski family - and that‚Äôs exactly what we are. We support each other to the ends of the earth and back. We hoot and holler and hug it out. We high five, talk shit, and lift each other up. The banter is brutal, the support is solid, and the love is endless. This is difference and something I‚Äôm so proud to be a part of. Love you nerds! Let‚Äôs blow this season out of the water! #mtncollective #salomonwmn üì∏ @arthurbertrand_photos",

Hiking around Pico Viejo was surreal. I was in a completely different world. It was cold, windy, with snow capped peaks surrounded by red moonscape and sparse canary pine.

          "comment": "What an incredible week in France with @salomonfreeski. Bringing the crew together to not only continue our backcountry education and expanding the range of gear, but to cultivate the bonds we have between each other. It‚Äôs one thing to have a sponsored freeski team, it‚Äôs another to have a freeski family - and that‚Äôs exactly what we are. We support each other to the ends of the earth and back. We hoot and holler and hug it out. We high five, talk shit, and lift each other up. The banter is brutal, the support is solid, and the love is endless. This is difference and something I‚Äôm so proud to be a part of. Love you nerds! Let‚Äôs blow this season out of the water! #mtncollective #salomonwmn üì∏ @arthurbertrand_photos",

Japan, Flat Out Friday moto race, solo pack rafting the Escalante River, riding through mainland and Baja, Mexico, Montenegro for @salomon #salomonwmn week, taking the FXR through Europe, backpacking through the Winds with my closest friends and boyfriend, paddleboarding all of Lake Powell with my best friend, and finishing with another #mtncollective with @salomonfreeski in France! Infinitely grateful for this life and the people in it. Thank you to my sponsors for supporting me year after year, couldn‚Äôt do this without you.

The first half of the year was spent working incredibly hard, balancing full time finance, part time route setting, and freelance creative jobs with climbing and training!  It was all in an effort to accomplish a long held dream of road tripping to Alaska!\n.\n\nI pushed too hard though, ignored several warning signs, and ended up taking a fall that severely injured my back. But our bodies are amazing things, and with lots of rehab and training, by early summer I was healthy and climbing again! Just in time for the second half of the year...The Great Alaskan Road Trip!!! üòÉ\n.\n\n@bobbysorich and I had the car packed and were set to leave in a few days time, when another driver failed to yield at an intersection and smashed into my passenger side! üò¶ I remember sitting there all dazed and confused, not really understanding what had just happened. Then someone shouted for an ambulance and I came to my senses. Thankfully, everybody involved ended up being okay, but my car was totaled. At first I was devastated. This couldn‚Äôt be happening. Not right now. Not after my back. Not after working so hard! Maybe it was rash and irresponsible, but I stubbornly refused to let the accident ruin my dreams of Alaska. I raced out to buy a new car, and within a week @bobbysorich and I were on the road! .\n\nOver the next five months, we experienced incredible adventures, sent our hardest climbs, shot some amazing creative projects, and spent quality time with family and friends! We also learned a lot about ourselves, relationships, and the realities of living in tiny spaces. .\n\nOverall, it wasn‚Äôt the easiest year, but it was an incredible year! I had so many wonderful opportunities, and learned a lot about balance, resilience, and believing in oneself!  I‚Äôm really proud of all the hard work that went into making this year happen, and so grateful to everyone that supported me along the way! I‚Äôm really excited for all the adventures and lessons yet to come in 2020!! . üì∑ @bobbysorich",

          "comment": "Happy New Year: Part 1 - On How I Rang in 2020! üò¥üò¥üò¥\n.\n\nBesides spending one day at home on the boat, where all I did was repack my bags for Joshua Tree, December 29th marked five months of being on the road, five months of big adventures and living in the tiny space of a Subaru! Though @bobbysorich and I had been hoping to stay in Joshua Tree through the new year, instead, we began to realize just how exhausted and burnt we were from our road trip. For several nights in JTree I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all, any little hiccup in the day would send me spiraling into tears, and I was climbing terribly! üòï And so, we did the unexpected thing, packed up, and went home early. New Year‚Äôs Eve and New Years Day were spent sleeping, eating, visiting friends, watching movies, riding bikes, and putting together a puzzle. For once, we didn‚Äôt climb or take photos or think about work responsibilities, and honestly it was AWESOME!! I tend to push too hard, always feeling pressure to work towards the next goal, and this New Year was a much needed reminder that life requires balance! We all need to make space for our physical and mental well being!  After just a few days at home I‚Äôm already feeling so much better, and can‚Äôt wait to take on 2020!  Wishing you all a year of good health and great adventures!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n.\n.\n.\n. üì∑ @bobbysorich from more epic times climbing in Idaho. #happynewyear #mentalhealthawareness #lifebalance #letsgo2020 #cityofrocks #climbidaho #sportclimbing #clippingbolts #climbingrevolution #climbon #doyouclimb #climbinggirls #girlswhoclimb #climbinglife #aworldlesstraveled #climbingmotivation #climbinginspiration #climbingphotography #teamevolv #alwaysevolv #allezoutdoor #wildernessgirls #playoutside #outdoorculture #adventurethatislife #adventurevisuals #climbhard #wallsaremeantforclimbing #climbyourimpossible #climbinglifestyle",

          "comment": "Anyone who knows me, knows I‚Äôm not exactly a cold weather climber. üòè The majority of my big sends have been in the 90 degree blazing sunlight, and I tend to start shivering when the temps dip below 75. Haha. But it‚Äôs not everyday you get invited to go bouldering in Hatcher Pass, Alaska! So despite the fact that it was 25 degrees and snowing, @bobbysorich and I joined a group of intrepid adventurers and hiked our pads out miles into the snow, where we hoped one overhanging boulder was going to be dry enough to climb.\n.\n\nWe were in luck and the day ended with @climby.meadows and I getting the send train on a beautiful, crimpy line called Dancing Queen, V8! I was really surprised I was able to send anything in such cold temps! But I‚Äôve learned a lot recently about keeping warm and comfortable during winter climbing. One of the most important things, is wearing proper layers! Instead of bulky clothing, I opt for several thinner, more flexible layers that I can easily take off or put on. Pictured here are two of my favourite pieces; the Backcountry Spruces Merino Base Layer Crew and Arcteryx Atom LT Vest for extra warmth around the core without restricting movement. Topped with a puffy and a weatherproof jacket and I stayed warm all day! Check out my stories today for more tips on cold weather climbing, and if you‚Äôre in need of any new gear, head on over to @backcountry and use my code KATIEJO15 for 15% off your first order!

          "comment": "Sending tons of gratitude out to this guy today!! Bobby and I met Cody (@climby.meadows) earlier on our trip in Squamish. In between crushing v11s, he chatted with us about his upcoming move to Anchorage, Alaska, where he was going to be working as a setter at the Alaska Rock Gym. It felt like fate!  We told Cody we‚Äôd be up in Alaska soon too and he encouraged us to come compete at the annual Pumpkin Pump bouldering comp at the @alaskarockgym. We made it to Alaska just in time and had such a blast competing! .\n\nOver the next month and a half, Cody constantly went out of his way to make us feel at home in Alaska, training with us at the gym, and showing us around town. Cody helped bring me on board as a guest setter, and made it his personal mission to make sure we got in some outdoor climbing, no matter how much snow we had to trek through!  He also put up with me forcing him to take this portrait because I liked the color of his jacket, so that says a lot! Haha. .\n\nIf anyone out there wants more info on climbing in Alaska, or plans to visit and needs some local beta, @climby.meadows is your guy!  Cody, I‚Äôm so stoked we ran into you in Squamish! Thanks for being such a kind and awesome person!! üôè üôèüôè .\n\n#climbingpartner #thankfulthursday #climbingportrait #climbingtrip #arcteryx @arcteryx @tensionclimbing #tensionclimbing #climbwithhonor #flashboard #butoraclimbing @climbbutora #teambutora #adventureportraits #athleteportrait #outdoorathlete #hatcherpass #alaskarockgym #alaskaclimbing #bouldering #boulderinglife",

In between crushing v11s, he chatted with us about his upcoming move to Anchorage, Alaska, where he was going to be working as a setter at the Alaska Rock Gym. It felt like fate!  We told Cody we‚Äôd be up in Alaska soon too and he encouraged us to come compete at the annual Pumpkin Pump bouldering comp at the @alaskarockgym. We made it to Alaska just in time and had such a blast competing! .\n\nOver the next month and a half, Cody constantly went out of his way to make us feel at home in Alaska, training with us at the gym, and showing us around town. Cody helped bring me on board as a guest setter, and made it his personal mission to make sure we got in some outdoor climbing, no matter how much snow we had to trek through!  He also put up with me forcing him to take this portrait because I liked the color of his jacket, so that says a lot! Haha. .\n\nIf anyone out there wants more info on climbing in Alaska, or plans to visit and needs some local beta, @climby.meadows is your guy!  Cody, I‚Äôm so stoked we ran into you in Squamish! Thanks for being such a kind and awesome person!! üôè üôèüôè .\n\n#climbingpartner #thankfulthursday #climbingportrait #climbingtrip #arcteryx @arcteryx @tensionclimbing #tensionclimbing #climbwithhonor #flashboard #butoraclimbing @climbbutora #teambutora #adventureportraits #athleteportrait #outdoorathlete #hatcherpass #alaskarockgym #alaskaclimbing #bouldering #boulderinglife",

It isn‚Äôt always easy to step out of your comfort zone like this, but it‚Äôs a great way to learn and become a stronger overall climber!  Due to its insecure nature and mental challenges, slab climbing is definitely a weakness for me, so I often try to push myself to climb harder slabs and really work on my head game!

          "comment": "Anyone who knows me, knows I‚Äôm not exactly a cold weather climber. üòè The majority of my big sends have been in the 90 degree blazing sunlight, and I tend to start shivering when the temps dip below 75. Haha. But it‚Äôs not everyday you get invited to go bouldering in Hatcher Pass, Alaska! So despite the fact that it was 25 degrees and snowing, @bobbysorich and I joined a group of intrepid adventurers and hiked our pads out miles into the snow, where we hoped one overhanging boulder was going to be dry enough to climb.\n.\n\nWe were in luck and the day ended with @climby.meadows and I getting the send train on a beautiful, crimpy line called Dancing Queen, V8! I was really surprised I was able to send anything in such cold temps! But I‚Äôve learned a lot recently about keeping warm and comfortable during winter climbing. One of the most important things, is wearing proper layers! Instead of bulky clothing, I opt for several thinner, more flexible layers that I can easily take off or put on. Pictured here are two of my favourite pieces; the Backcountry Spruces Merino Base Layer Crew and Arcteryx Atom LT Vest for extra warmth around the core without restricting movement. Topped with a puffy and a weatherproof jacket and I stayed warm all day! Check out my stories today for more tips on cold weather climbing, and if you‚Äôre in need of any new gear, head on over to @backcountry and use my code KATIEJO15 for 15% off your first order! (Exclusions Apply) #findyourbackcountry #sponsored #backcountry .\n\nThanks to @bobbysorich for the pic and @climby.meadows, @davethomaspictures and @twentyfreeten for the great adventure! #winterweather #beanieweather #yellowbeanie  #arcteryx #hatcherpass #alaskaclimbing #bouldering #boulderinglife #boulderingbabes #climbinggirls #girlswhoclimb #dancingqueen #climbingphotography #climbingmotivation #winterclimbing #winterclothing #layerup #teamevolv #alwaysevolv #climbingrevolution #winterishere #winteradventures #climbtime #climbing_pictures_of_instagram #thenorthface #visitalaska #playinthesnow @thenorthface_climb @arcteryx @evolv_worldwide",

And then there are those other trips...the ones with the crazy weather, soggy rocks, fallen boulders, crushed camera bags, lost family members, lots of tears, high winds, and accidental eyebrow burnings... .\n\nNeedless to say, our holiday week in Joshua Tree did not go entirely to plan. But sometimes all you can do is keep your chin up and go play in the snow!  Despite all the mishaps, it was really special to experience Joshua Tree as a winter wonderland. Myself, @bobbysorich, and @abfishclimb had a great time exploring and enjoying the park in a new way! ‚ùÑÔ∏è I also can‚Äôt thank Austin enough for being such an amazing human being and friend!

Though @bobbysorich and I had been hoping to stay in Joshua Tree through the new year, instead, we began to realize just how exhausted and burnt we were from our road trip. For several nights in JTree I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all, any little hiccup in the day would send me spiraling into tears, and I was climbing terribly! üòï And so, we did the unexpected thing, packed up, and went home early. New Year‚Äôs Eve and New Years Day were spent sleeping, eating, visiting friends, watching movies, riding bikes, and putting together a puzzle. For once, we didn‚Äôt climb or take photos or think about work responsibilities, and honestly it was AWESOME!! I tend to push too hard, always feeling pressure to work towards the next goal, and this New Year was a much needed reminder that life requires balance! We all need to make space for our physical and mental well being!  After just a few days at home I‚Äôm already feeling so much better, and can‚Äôt wait to take on 2020!  Wishing you all a year of good health and great adventures!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n.\n.\n.\n. üì∑ @bobbysorich from more epic times climbing in Idaho. #happynewyear #mentalhealthawareness #lifebalance #letsgo2020 #cityofrocks #climbidaho #sportclimbing #clippingbolts #climbingrevolution #climbon #doyouclimb #climbinggirls #girlswhoclimb #climbinglife #aworldlesstraveled #climbingmotivation #climbinginspiration #climbingphotography #teamevolv #alwaysevolv #allezoutdoor #wildernessgirls #playoutside #outdoorculture #adventurethatislife #adventurevisuals #climbhard #wallsaremeantforclimbing #climbyourimpossible #climbinglifestyle",

The first half of the year was spent working incredibly hard, balancing full time finance, part time route setting, and freelance creative jobs with climbing and training!  It was all in an effort to accomplish a long held dream of road tripping to Alaska!\n.\n\nI pushed too hard though, ignored several warning signs, and ended up taking a fall that severely injured my back. But our bodies are amazing things, and with lots of rehab and training, by early summer I was healthy and climbing again! Just in time for the second half of the year...The Great Alaskan Road Trip!!! üòÉ\n.\n\n@bobbysorich and I had the car packed and were set to leave in a few days time, when another driver failed to yield at an intersection and smashed into my passenger side! üò¶ I remember sitting there all dazed and confused, not really understanding what had just happened. Then someone shouted for an ambulance and I came to my senses. Thankfully, everybody involved ended up being okay, but my car was totaled. At first I was devastated. This couldn‚Äôt be happening. Not right now. Not after my back. Not after working so hard! Maybe it was rash and irresponsible, but I stubbornly refused to let the accident ruin my dreams of Alaska. I raced out to buy a new car, and within a week @bobbysorich and I were on the road! .\n\nOver the next five months, we experienced incredible adventures, sent our hardest climbs, shot some amazing creative projects, and spent quality time with family and friends! We also learned a lot about ourselves, relationships, and the realities of living in tiny spaces. .\n\nOverall, it wasn‚Äôt the easiest year, but it was an incredible year! I had so many wonderful opportunities, and learned a lot about balance, resilience, and believing in oneself!  I‚Äôm really proud of all the hard work that went into making this year happen, and so grateful to everyone that supported me along the way! I‚Äôm really excited for all the adventures and lessons yet to come in 2020!! . üì∑ @bobbysorich",

Ich kann momentan nicht Skifahren. Ich bin verletzt und ich bin ehrlich. Gestern habe ich schon eine Tr√§ne verdr√ºckt, als ich an diesem frisch verschneiten Tag an den Skifahrern auf der Piste mit meinen Kr√ºcken vorbei gehumpelt bin. üôà ABER...ich bin trotzdem gl√ºcklich und zufrieden und genau das ist eine der h√§ufigsten Fragen, die ich oft gestellt bekomme. Wie schaffst du es immer so positiv und gl√ºcklich zu sein? üôåüèª Meine Antwort. Das bin ich nicht. Ich bin nicht Superwomen. ABER das m√ºssen wir auch gar nicht sein. Ich bin gl√ºcklich und zufrieden, weil ich jeden Tag sch√§tze und weil ich meinen Rucksack mit all den Steinen, die das Leben bringt einfach Schritt f√ºr Schritt  weiter trage. Es geht nicht darum wie schnell wir sind, oder ob wir immer dabei lachen, sondern es geht darum jeden Tag den n√§chsten Schritt zu gehen und nicht stehen zu bleiben. Also glaubt an euch. Glaub an dich und deine Tr√§ume. Und glaub daran, dass du bald wieder Skifahren wirst üòãüòâ und bis dahin trotzdem jeden Tag rocknrollst. üåü@karriere.at greift dir bei deinem Traum jetzt unter die Arme und mit der ‚ÄûWillst du, kannst du‚Äú Challenge kannst du 1000‚Ç¨ f√ºr deinen Traum gewinnen...zB. f√ºr deine neuen Ski? Dein Familienwochenende im Schnee? Deine n√§chste Gipfelbesteigung? Die n√§chste H√ºttentour mit Freunden?Urlaub in √ñsterreich...egal was, sei kreativ und beschreibe deinen Traum...üåüWas du daf√ºr tun musst? 18 Jahre alt sein, Wohnsitz in √ñsterreich haben und das wichtigste bis zum 31.12.19 mit einem Post und den Hashtags #wdkdchallenge #willstdukannstdu und dem Tag @karriere.at deinen Traum verraten. Mach mit und ich dr√ºcke dir die Daumen üíì‚úäüèª #traum #liebe #love #leben #dream #happy #ziele #business #erfolg  #life #kreativit√§t #motivation #heldsein #unternehmer #freiheit #happy #me #wdkdchallenge #karriereat",

Ich kann momentan nicht Skifahren. Ich bin verletzt und ich bin ehrlich. Gestern habe ich schon eine Tr√§ne verdr√ºckt, als ich an diesem frisch verschneiten Tag an den Skifahrern auf der Piste mit meinen Kr√ºcken vorbei gehumpelt bin. üôà ABER...ich bin trotzdem gl√ºcklich und zufrieden und genau das ist eine der h√§ufigsten Fragen, die ich oft gestellt bekomme. Wie schaffst du es immer so positiv und gl√ºcklich zu sein? üôåüèª Meine Antwort. Das bin ich nicht. Ich bin nicht Superwomen. ABER das m√ºssen wir auch gar nicht sein. Ich bin gl√ºcklich und zufrieden, weil ich jeden Tag sch√§tze und weil ich meinen Rucksack mit all den Steinen, die das Leben bringt einfach Schritt f√ºr Schritt  weiter trage. Es geht nicht darum wie schnell wir sind, oder ob wir immer dabei lachen, sondern es geht darum jeden Tag den n√§chsten Schritt zu gehen und nicht stehen zu bleiben. Also glaubt an euch. Glaub an dich und deine Tr√§ume. Und glaub daran, dass du bald wieder Skifahren wirst üòãüòâ und bis dahin trotzdem jeden Tag rocknrollst. üåü@karriere.at greift dir bei deinem Traum jetzt unter die Arme und mit der ‚ÄûWillst du, kannst du‚Äú Challenge kannst du 1000‚Ç¨ f√ºr deinen Traum gewinnen...zB. f√ºr deine neuen Ski?

          "comment": "Hey it‚Äôs me ‚úåüèª ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\n\nI get asked a lot about how I afford  to travel all the time and what I do for a living ‚Äî here‚Äôs my story: ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\n\nI started this Instagram account when I was in university in 2016 as a fun way to share my travel photos when I was studying abroad. It was nothing more than a distraction from the senioritis I was feeling on the last leg of university. However, starting that account in the OG days of Instagram, I gained a small following on it! I got asked to do some brand deals in the early days, but right before I graduated I also snagged an online project management gig, where I was remotely managing a brand‚Äôs social media and blog. That was enough to convince me not to take on a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù right away and instead go on a trip to SE Asia. One thing led to another and I never really stopped traveling üôà. About a year ago, I quit my online job and fully jumped into working and as a content creator. My full time career right now is content creation. I work with and bring brands all over the world with me. I share them on this platform, as well as create content that they use for themselves. It‚Äôs an exciting concept to work for myself while simultaneously being able to share my creativity and passion for adventure on this platform. It‚Äôs an interesting career that I never thought I‚Äôd be in, but I‚Äôm addicted to the freedom it provides. I hope that gives some clarity haha üòå",

My favorite flavor is vanilla, but they also come in a variety of fruity flavors like Watermelon and Raspberry and has SPF 20 for extra protection!

It was nothing more than a distraction from the senioritis I was feeling on the last leg of university. However, starting that account in the OG days of Instagram, I gained a small following on it! I got asked to do some brand deals in the early days, but right before I graduated I also snagged an online project management gig, where I was remotely managing a brand‚Äôs social media and blog. That was enough to convince me not to take on a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù right away and instead go on a trip to SE Asia. One thing led to another and I never really stopped traveling üôà. About a year ago, I quit my online job and fully jumped into working and as a content creator. My full time career right now is content creation. I work with and bring brands all over the world with me. I share them on this platform, as well as create content that they use for themselves. It‚Äôs an exciting concept to work for myself while simultaneously being able to share my creativity and passion for adventure on this platform. It‚Äôs an interesting career that I never thought I‚Äôd be in, but I‚Äôm addicted to the freedom it provides. I hope that gives some clarity haha üòå",

I usually don't have time to grab breakfast and by the time mid-morning hits, I get hangry. This time around, I brought a bunch of @powerupsnacks with me to much on the go. They're full of nutritious wholesome ingredients like nuts, berries and even dark chocolate! Bringing a bag along on any adventure, is a great way to curb your appetite while getting a bunch of protein, antioxidants and omegas from real ingredients you can see! *ad #powerupsnacks",

          "comment": "A few years ago Nick bought me a welder for Christmas. At first I was really excited and then soon after I became overwhelmed and a little bit scared of the heavy machine. I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit that I was nervous to learn something new, constantly told myself I was too busy to learn and doubted that I could even do it. Even though the welder sat in a closet unopened for almost two years, I imagined one day learning how to weld and dreamt of all the things I would create. I still have dreams of creating furniture, art, and even railings for our home one day. This past year, @acehardware has been a constant and amazing supporter of mine. They have encouraged me to continuously be creative and have motivated me to step outside the box of everyday life and routine to create something new. With encouragement from my local Ace Hardware Store ( @salidaace ), I mustered up the courage to drag the welder out of the dark closet, dust off the box and open it for the first time. I then signed up for a couple of lessons and worked with @salidaace to get all of the necessary tools needed to begin welding on my own. I am still very much in the beginning phase and just learning and practicing the basics. I am grateful for this new creative outlet in my life and realize now that my hopes of creating the things I once imagined are actually in reach.¬†¬†#MyLocalAce #AcePartner @acehardware",

          "comment": "I love third wheeling with my sister. Last weekend I met up with Kenzie and her boyfriend and tagged along with them to go get a Christmas tree in the mountains behind their house (they are very cute). We skied in with friends and brought warm coffee & peanut butter chocolate hemp bars for some energy. It was the perfect day and began dumping snow as we skied our way back to the truck. This was a casual and perfect way to test out a new pair of skis I just got from backcountry.com. While I grew up skiing, I am very new to skinning up and the backcountry stuff but it is something I am eager to learn and get better at (it‚Äôs a killer workout!) I am moving to Steamboat Springs later this year and so excited to have some of Colorado‚Äôs best mountains out the backdoor. I‚Äôm hoping to take this learning curve easy and learn slowly, and most importantly put safety first always. Thank you to @backcountry for setting me up with my new skis, boots and bindings. They offer free 2-day shipping which is great this time of year with the holidays approaching quick and you can get 15% off your first order at Backcountry using my code MADDIEB15 (exclusions apply). Backcountry partners with the Nature Conservancy so please be sure to help give back to the outdoors by donating to @nature_org during checkout. #FindYourBackcountry #Sponsored #Backcountry",

          "comment": "*If you use CBD or are curious about CBD, this post is for you!\n\nHas anyone else found the language around CBD dosage confusing? I did when I first started using CBD. I remember asking why it was not made more clear on the packaging? The reason for this is because the amount of CBD you should take depends on you and your own body. Generally, most CBD companies like @cbdistillery_ recommend 30-60mg per day for the average adult but again, this depends on what works best for you - it could be less or it could be more and it‚Äôs important to note that everyone‚Äôs body will react differently. When figuring out what dose is best for you, it‚Äôs recommended to keep track, test in small increases and don‚Äôt be afraid to increase your dose (taking an increased dose of CBD from @cbdistillery_ is not harmful). Check out @cbdistillery_ for some of the best, high quality CBD products available and use my code MADDIE to receive 15% off on top of the current sale they have going. For more information on dosage, see link in my bio! @cbdistillery_ #cbdmovement #sponsored",

          "comment": "I love third wheeling with my sister. Last weekend I met up with Kenzie and her boyfriend and tagged along with them to go get a Christmas tree in the mountains behind their house (they are very cute). We skied in with friends and brought warm coffee & peanut butter chocolate hemp bars for some energy. It was the perfect day and began dumping snow as we skied our way back to the truck. This was a casual and perfect way to test out a new pair of skis I just got from backcountry.com. While I grew up skiing, I am very new to skinning up and the backcountry stuff but it is something I am eager to learn and get better at (it‚Äôs a killer workout!) I am moving to Steamboat Springs later this year and so excited to have some of Colorado‚Äôs best mountains out the backdoor. I‚Äôm hoping to take this learning curve easy and learn slowly, and most importantly put safety first always. Thank you to @backcountry for setting me up with my new skis, boots and bindings. They offer free 2-day shipping which is great this time of year with the holidays approaching quick and you can get 15% off your first order at Backcountry using my code MADDIEB15 (exclusions apply). Backcountry partners with the Nature Conservancy so please be sure to help give back to the outdoors by donating to @nature_org during checkout. #FindYourBackcountry #Sponsored #Backcountry",

          "comment": "A few years ago Nick bought me a welder for Christmas. At first I was really excited and then soon after I became overwhelmed and a little bit scared of the heavy machine. I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit that I was nervous to learn something new, constantly told myself I was too busy to learn and doubted that I could even do it. Even though the welder sat in a closet unopened for almost two years, I imagined one day learning how to weld and dreamt of all the things I would create. I still have dreams of creating furniture, art, and even railings for our home one day. This past year, @acehardware has been a constant and amazing supporter of mine. They have encouraged me to continuously be creative and have motivated me to step outside the box of everyday life and routine to create something new. With encouragement from my local Ace Hardware Store ( @salidaace ), I mustered up the courage to drag the welder out of the dark closet, dust off the box and open it for the first time. I then signed up for a couple of lessons and worked with @salidaace to get all of the necessary tools needed to begin welding on my own. I am still very much in the beginning phase and just learning and practicing the basics. I am grateful for this new creative outlet in my life and realize now that my hopes of creating the things I once imagined are actually in reach.¬†¬†#MyLocalAce #AcePartner @acehardware",

We have a saying there that is more a rule than anything else: \"There is no bad weather, only bad clothing\". When you had to go outside on breaks in school you would be bummed and think that the teachers are evil and this is not true the weather is shit come on let us be insideeeeee (quote by 10 year old Malou). Now that i'm older I get it. I spend the winter months skiing in interior British Columbia, which isn't much warmer than where I grew up. It's cold, dark and it snows all the time. I've been testing out @thenorthfaceuk FUTURELIGHT products and being out in the elements when you have the right gear makes all the difference in the world.\n\n#nkskserviceteam #NeverStopExploring #FUTURELIGHT",

We have a saying there that is more a rule than anything else: \"There is no bad weather, only bad clothing\". When you had to go outside on breaks in school you would be bummed and think that the teachers are evil and this is not true the weather is shit come on let us be insideeeeee (quote by 10 year old Malou). Now that i'm older I get it. I spend the winter months skiing in interior British Columbia, which isn't much warmer than where I grew up. It's cold, dark and it snows all the time. I've been testing out @thenorthfaceuk FUTURELIGHT products and being out in the elements when you have the right gear makes all the difference in the world.\n\n#nkskserviceteam #NeverStopExploring #FUTURELIGHT",

Moving rocks, building fences, digging holes. Anything to be outdoors. Not much has changed. While I might not be cleaning up after the horses anymore.. I take every moment I can to be adventuring. Nature has a way of healing, bringing me home. I feel this connection with others around me, my friends have the same inclinations. Texture, colors, the sounds and ever changing weather.

Credit cards were this magical thing and I had no idea of the consequences when used irresponsibly.\n.\n‚Ä¢I had low paying admin jobs for many years and not only could I never get a raise, but I was consistently living paycheck-to-paycheck and outside my means - thus continuing to use credit cards.\n.\n‚Ä¢And due to all of the above... I was unable to save. To build an emergency fund and to contribute anything substantial to my retirement plan.\n.\nBUT, as of today... the last day of the year I am completely debt free. I have a solid emergency fund/nest egg and I‚Äôve been investing heavily (over the last couple years) in my retirement plan in an attempt to catch up.\n.\nI felt a LOT of shame due to my financial situation for many years and it was something I kept hidden from the people in my life... but now, I feel so proud.\n.\nTruth be told guys, I couldn‚Äôt have done it without you and to say I feel blessed is the understatement of the year. It‚Äôs such an immense privilege to be able earn money through my photography and Instagram. A privilege I sometimes don‚Äôt feel worthy of. But here I am and I‚Äôm changed because of it. So, as always... thank you for being here and your support. I am eternally grateful. üôèüèº\n.\nCheers to 2019, to fresh starts, positive changes and to an incredible year to come.

          "comment": "Hola friends!! I‚Äôve got a Peru trip UPDATE to share! ü§ó If you signed up for trip email notifications, then you already know... ;)\n.\nWhen working with @Trovatrip on my Peru itinerary for this October, I originally made the choice to nix Machu Picchu. My options were to either do more of a hiking trip or more of a touristy trip, and I chose hiking - which did not include the iconic destination. But I realized after the fact is that people want to do BOTH!\n.\nSooo‚Ä¶ exciting news, it‚Äôs now available as an optional add-on to the itinerary! ü•≥ This add-on would extend the trip by an additional day/night, but we thought it was a great thing to be able to offer people that won‚Äôt want to fuss with trying to arrange it for themselves.\n.\nDetails about the trip can be found in the link in my bio! We made some updates to the website, so if you don‚Äôt see the info about Machu Picchu on the main page - try using your web browser instead. And for those who have already signed up and want to add Machu Picchu, simply email the kind folks over at @trovatrip and they will get you squared away. üôåüèº\n.\nIt‚Äôs going to be an incredible trip! If you have any questions about the trip or even how traveling as a group with a bunch of strangers (soon to be friends) works - don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out!\n.\nPhoto by: @outofthewoods",

It‚Äôs not fun having low energy and even lower motivation, but I‚Äôm working on not feeling guilty for it.

          "comment": "Sure, I did some fun stuff in 2019... but the biggest highlights of the year for me were financial ones.\n.\n‚Ä¢You see, I learned poor spending habits as a young adult. Credit cards were this magical thing and I had no idea of the consequences when used irresponsibly.\n.\n‚Ä¢I had low paying admin jobs for many years and not only could I never get a raise, but I was consistently living paycheck-to-paycheck and outside my means - thus continuing to use credit cards.\n.\n‚Ä¢And due to all of the above... I was unable to save. To build an emergency fund and to contribute anything substantial to my retirement plan.\n.\nBUT, as of today... the last day of the year I am completely debt free. I have a solid emergency fund/nest egg and I‚Äôve been investing heavily (over the last couple years) in my retirement plan in an attempt to catch up.\n.\nI felt a LOT of shame due to my financial situation for many years and it was something I kept hidden from the people in my life... but now, I feel so proud.\n.\nTruth be told guys, I couldn‚Äôt have done it without you and to say I feel blessed is the understatement of the year. It‚Äôs such an immense privilege to be able earn money through my photography and Instagram. A privilege I sometimes don‚Äôt feel worthy of. But here I am and I‚Äôm changed because of it. So, as always... thank you for being here and your support. I am eternally grateful. üôèüèº\n.\nCheers to 2019, to fresh starts, positive changes and to an incredible year to come. Catch ya in the new year! ü•Ç",

          "comment": "oh hello. it‚Äôs the end of the year, and i was having an introspective time while roasting my chestnuts by the open fire last night. thoughts about how diverse my year was, about giving back, and about how many times i‚Äôve almost broken my ankle. i realized i‚Äôve been very lucky to be able to do some really cool things this year through the simple fact that you follow me. how you allow my content to infiltrate your life like a jolly (wo)man sliding down your digital chimney.\n.\ni wanted to say thanks somehow, so have decided to implement the very first üéÅ pattie presents üéÅ it‚Äôs as simple as you hitting my DM‚Äôs, or commenting on this post. just tell me what you need to get outside and help others do the same.\n.\ndid your coat get stolen this year? do you know an awesome charity that needs some extra help? would you like your first pair of hiking boots? let me know what it is and why, from serious to silly, and i shall endevour to help out. i won‚Äôt be able to pick everyone of course, but i have $1000 to give away in gift cards different amounts from @backcountry to make this a #sponsored post, 10 coats to give away from @backcountry too, and $2500 lump sum to give to a non-profit specifically serving minority communities from an anonymous donor who reached out last week.\n.\ni just thought it would be nice that you got something out of this relationship for a change. so happy holigays. comment away. tell me what‚Äôs needed. tell me what non-profit/org is close to your heart. tell me who‚Äôs day we could make. no really, go do it. especially if you personally are in need.\n.\nüì∏ @daynaturnblom",

I was always trying to be somewhere else, to prove something, and definitely to escape from my feelings...\n‚Üü \nAnd now that @charles_post and I are almost always home, after so many years of never being fully happy, I‚Äôve realized that you can be happy or unhappy anywhere. You have to take the time to do the deep work, and traveling can honestly make that process take a lot longer if you‚Äôre just checking off bucket list places instead of actually taking the time to BE somewhere (which can help us grow a lot).\n‚Üü \nBecause no matter how amazing life looks on the outside, it‚Äôs how you feel inside that counts.\n‚Üü \nMy happiness has increased so much since I decided to just be myself. Not some Instagram travel influencer, but an artist. An athlete. A Montana girl who kinda just wants to be in Montana. Really, just a person who wants to live the best life I can and help others do the same.\n‚Üü \nSo while I don‚Äôt know just where I‚Äôm going with my business, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll want to travel more some day, I know I‚Äôm going to be home a lot more, grow inwards and stop distracting myself with what doesn‚Äôt really improve my life. I‚Äôm going to just enjoy my time with @charles_post and @mr.knute because they, more than anything else, help my happiness grow by the day.\n‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü \nMy final shop update before the holidays is tomorrow (Wednesday) at 3 p.m. MST. I‚Äôm so excited to share a ton of new goodies and get some out of stock favorites back in stock (in limited quantities!) Thank you for all the love this holiday season, it means more than I can say to our little family! // #rachelpohlart #mrknute #happytears #ahsaunas",

          "comment": "Self care is not selfish, it‚Äôs not an indulgence. It is necessary for your physical and mental health.\n‚öò \nYou don‚Äôt need a bunch of money or leisure time to take care of yourself. And you should not wait until you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it or wait until you‚Äôve taken care of everyone else to think about your needs.\n‚öò \nSelf care CAN be getting a massage, a day at the spa, or hiring a personal trainer. It CAN be a juice cleanse or a facial or a superfood salad- but don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking that‚Äôs what self care is.\n‚öò \nSelf care is saying *no* and protecting your time. It‚Äôs drinking enough water every day and saying no to what makes you feel bad. It‚Äôs eating your favorite meal, taking moments to breathe mindfully, move your body, daydream a bit. It‚Äôs taking time to read a book, watch your favorite show, create, paint, play music.\n‚öò \nSelf care doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive and it doesn‚Äôt have to take more time than you can give to it. Anyone can slip in moments of calm, short periods of joy, and slices of self care when we can- but the first step is saying yes to those windows.\n‚öò \nEverything you need to practice self care is right here. All you need is your brain to stop thinking self care is selfish and a few moments that are just for you, that you carve out whenever you have the chance, because you deserve to make more time for you. Ask for help so you can do more things you love. Tell people no who you don‚Äôt actually want to give your time to.\n‚öò \nIt‚Äôs not an indulgence after all to take care of yourself- it‚Äôs essential to your health and happiness!\n‚öò ‚öò ‚öò \nI‚Äôm SO DELIGHTED to say my yoga mats are officially in stock! There‚Äôs a link to them in my bio or visit RACHELPOHLART.com. Mat and calendar orders will ship next week!!\n‚öò \nAnd because I know this time of year can be hard in many ways, tag a friend who could really use some kindness.\nIn the comments say why they could use a yoga mat this holiday season, and the friend you nominate will be entered to win a free mat of their choice!! Winner is @mtn_babe_801 ! #rachelpohlart",

          "comment": "It didn‚Äôt happen overnight. I didn‚Äôt just wake up one day with an art career, a husband, a dog, a house, and all of this.\n‚ãí \nTen years ago I graduated from high school with some big dreams of being an artist. Over the last decade I‚Äôve fought so hard for everything I have. At times I fought for my health, both mental and physical. At others I had to stand up to people and circumstances that threatened my dreams. I worked as a nanny and babysat for a long long time before I could support myself on my art. Since then, I traveled to a dozen counties and I‚Äôve already grown my business far beyond my wildest dreams... I married the man of my dreams and got a pup that loves the snow and cold as much as we do...\n‚ãí \nBut my greatest success in the last ten years is not what I‚Äôve acquired, accomplished, or where I‚Äôve traveled- but who I‚Äôve become. The peace I‚Äôve found in accepting who I am has allowed me to create a life I‚Äôm proud of and not one bound by other‚Äôs expectations.\n‚ãí \nI‚Äôm really excited for the next ten years. I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to become even more ‚Äúme.‚Äù Set goals you guys- it works. People who don‚Äôt set goals don‚Äôt expect enough from themselves. Be disciplined, don‚Äôt worry if you change your dreams, but don‚Äôt be afraid to make things happen, make mistakes, make some magic.\n‚ãí \nWhat are your intentions for this year and the next decade??\n‚ãí ‚ãí ‚ãí \nPhoto by @charles_post #adventuresamoyeds #hikingwithdogs #skiingwithdogs #mrknute #backcountryskiing #2020 #intentions #creativehappylife #artistslife",

          "comment": "The days are now getting longer... though personally, I love the darkness.\n‚ãí \nI love the cold, deep snow, and starry nights. I long for winter in the summer. I know I‚Äôm the opposite from many people, and it doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense why I prefer short, bitter cold days to long, hot ones.\n‚ãí \nMaybe it was how I was raised, maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been skiing for 25 years and it‚Äôs still my favorite thing to do.\n‚ãí \nBut maybe it‚Äôs because I tend to expect so much from myself, and the darkness gives me an excuse to rest more. In summer I become frustrated by the length of days, the heat, the general ‚Äúhurry up and get all the summer activities in‚Äù feeling. But winter says ‚Äúrest, recalibrate, create.‚Äù\n‚ãí \nThis is my season. The light, the alpenglow on snowy peaks, the color of quickening shadows, the contrast between beautiful sparkly days in the mountains and being tucked in beneath the stars at night, between cold that takes your breath away and a fire that warms your bones.\n‚ãí \nMaybe I need to learn a thing or two from people who love summer- and maybe if you don‚Äôt love winter you can learn a thing or two from this perspective: without darkness, long summer days are so much less special. Without cold, the warmth of summer means less. Without the hard moments in our lives, we feel less gratitude for the truly great ones.\n‚ãí \nSo try to appreciate all the seasons, especially the season you‚Äôre in right now- even if it‚Äôs not your favorite. Everything is always changing- learn to see the beauty in that.\n‚ãí \nHappy (belated) solstice to all of you!\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n#rachelpohlart #solstice #wintersolstice #tetons #grandtetonnationalpark #mountaingirls #mountainlife #livecolorfully #alpenglow #nordicspirit #creativehappylife #winterismyseason #winterwonderland",

It‚Äôs not particularly flattering, impressive, or beautiful, but it makes me really happy.\n‚Üü \nBut I‚Äôve changed a lot in this past year. I don‚Äôt care as much about what all but a handful of people think. I know that there‚Äôs beauty in the simple little things that maybe only I fully understand...\n‚Üü \nBecause in the end it doesn‚Äôt really matter how everyone else felt about our lives- only we know if we‚Äôre living our best life possible, only we know what it feels like to be us.\n‚Üü \nHere‚Äôs a few moments from one of our many little ski tours this past week. Though we don‚Äôt have much snow and the skiing has been far from amazing, we‚Äôve still been getting out every day on little logging roads in a canyon near our home- because that‚Äôs what makes us happy. So I hope you enjoy this unedited, fuzzy, silly photo of me and my best little pal.\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n#sharewhatyoulove #winterwonderland #skiing #backcountryskiing #samoyedpuppy #mrknute #mountainlife #mountainpups #adventuresamoyeds",

Let go of trying to be everything to everyone, all the time.\n‚Üü \nLet go of the past- good or bad. Of trying to always prove something. Let go of labeling yourself and others. Of blaming and shaming and judging. Of thinking you‚Äôre not good enough. Let go of thinking ‚Äúwhen ____ happens I‚Äôll be happy.‚Äù\n‚Üü \nLet go of controlling everything. Let go of wishing you or the people around you were different. Let go of caring what strangers think, and of measuring your worth against them.\n‚Üü \nLet go of good vs evil, black and white, right or wrong- and instead embrace other opinions and nuances.\n‚Üü ‚Üü \nLet go of trying to *let go* perfectly. Because letting go is about release, not rejection. It‚Äôs about not holding on so tightly...\n‚Üü \nBecause once you start to let go, you‚Äôll find you‚Äôve been free all along. Because when you learn to move past which does not serve you (that you‚Äôre clutching onto so tightly) you can reach for what lights you up.\n‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü \nThis photo from a little nordic ski with @charles_post @mr.knute a few days ago sums up letting go of so much... and embracing the little happy moments that fill me up. Happy last day of the decade everyone!\n‚Üü \nWhat are you letting go of this year?",

Because at my core I just love to paint and will do whatever it takes, including waking up hours before the sun, to make that happen.\n‚ãí \nI‚Äôm so excited to say I just added all 22 of these original ornaments to the shop!\n‚ãí \nI‚Äôve worked 12-15 hours every day the past week, and everyone on my little team has been working so hard as well- and though I‚Äôm exhausted, the love from all of you is keeping me going.\n‚ãí \nThere‚Äôs a link to ornaments in my bio or visit RACHELPOHLART.com!! I also added some out of stock face masks (like Torres Del Paine!), ‚Äúpaintbrush‚Äù art bags, a few chalk bags, new stickers, and more!! The shop update has arrived!!\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n#rachelpohlart #ornaments #mountainart #shopupdate #makersgonnamake #livecolorfully #painteveryday",

You won‚Äôt get everything done on your to do list. You‚Äôll be late, forget about important details, burn dinner, miss out on opportunities. You will eat a whole box of cookies.\n‚Üü \nYou will be tempted to criticize yourself for your failures (in a way you‚Äôd never criticize a friend).\n‚Üü \nBut go easy on yourself.\n‚Üü \nBecause when things are hard, you don‚Äôt need to beat yourself up, because making a mistake is hard enough without further compounding it with negative self talk. Instead, be kind and patient. Life happens, so move on with grace and remember that what you‚Äôre learning now can shape you into a better person tomorrow.\n‚Üü \nSo go easy on yourself, because you‚Äôre doing your best. ‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü ‚ÄúFairy Meadows‚Äù @kindapparelco fleece leggings are here!

          "comment": "A year ago @charles_post and I bought our first home, nested on ten acres of land near these very mountains.\n‚ãí \nWe are now stewards of this slice of earth, and that has some weight to it. Last summer, we planted trees + native flowers, and our goal is to create even more wildlife habitat and food for pollinators in the years to come.\n‚ãí \nIf you think about it though, regardless of how much land you ‚Äúown,‚Äù we all have access to so much nature- National Parks, National forest, wilderness areas... the health and well-being of these places and the wildlife that inhabit them are our collective responsibility.\n‚ãí \nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to partner with @parksproject because our public lands need our help, now more than ever. Each @parksproject purchase directly contributes to one of 50+ non-profit groups protecting parks and public lands in North America, providing necessary funding for the ongoing care of National Parks and public lands. I‚Äôve admired their company for a long time and I‚Äôm so honored to be able to spread the word about the work they facilitate!!\n‚ãí \nFor example, with every Joshua Tree product sold (like this awesome tee I‚Äôm wearing!) together we support the monitoring and protection of trees in the park. I was lucky enough to climb and paint in Joshua Tree some years ago, and it‚Äôs a special place to me (anyone else been there?)\n‚ãí \nIt saddens me to know that Joshua trees are now struggling to survive. Invasive plants, fire, and climate change are taking an enormous toll. Volunteers and partners work hard to collect data, remove invasive plants, and create fuel breaks to protect a beautiful species that symbolizes California deserts. Like every Park these days, Joshua Tree is in a fragile state. Thankfully, due to the @parksproject partnership, 12,089 hectares of Joshua Tree have been restored!\n‚ãí \nSo if you‚Äôd like to give back to the places that give us so much, check out @parksproject !! Because here we are ALL land owners regardless of if we‚Äôve put down roots,¬†and together we can make a difference for our public lands. // #parksproject #protectwhatyoulove",

And also to not take things so seriously... because when we‚Äôre just genuinely excited about the people in our lives and curious about all the beauty around us, life gets better.\n‚ûµ \nHope you enjoy this photo of Knute- I think he looks most like a baby seal here (swipe to zoom!!) what do you think?\n‚ûµ \nAlso, @mr.knute is 4 months old today üò≠üò≠ he‚Äôs growing way too fast, this photo is from about a month ago. We are just trying to soak up every moment of his puppyhood!\n‚ûµ ‚ûµ ‚ûµ \nThank you @scottjamesjewelry for making this beautiful, special dog tag and @valleyknits for making me the most incredible sweater. #supportsmallbusiness #mrknute #closeears",

          "comment": "Want to know something funny?\n‚ùÖ \nI didn‚Äôt share any of my art on here for a long while, then only occasionally. I was certainly pursuing a career as an artist, I just didn‚Äôt think this was a very important place to help that happen. It also made me feel vulnerable sharing my work with an audience I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know‚Äù- what if people didn‚Äôt like my art? What if they liked it but I knew I could do better??\n‚ùÖ \nBut if we wait until our work (whatever that may be) is perfect before sharing it with the world, we might never do so.\n‚ùÖ \nMy art business didn‚Äôt really flourish until I started really putting myself out there, began pouring my time and effort into my art AND sharing it. I realized the power of this platform then figured out how to grow my following- through just being myself and A LOT of effort.\n‚ùÖ \nSo my advice today is this: if there‚Äôs something you want to pursue, don‚Äôt wait for years like I did to share it with the world! Just start and don‚Äôt care so much about what *everyone* thinks. And if you put in the time on your craft and business, you too can make a career out of what you love. And no instagram is not the only way to make that happen! It has just been a really helpful tool for me to reach an audience :) ‚ùÖ ‚ùÖ ‚ùÖ\n‚ÄúWinter Flatirons‚Äù original on barn wood is up on my site and linked in my bio- if this special piece strikes your fancy, we can ship it out in the next few hours in time for Christmas!

It‚Äôs not how YOU look. It‚Äôs not about accolades or accomplishments. Your self worth should not be measured by your net worth.\n‚ãí \nWhat matters is how you‚Äôre life FEELS. Your inner state of happiness. The way people in your life make you feel and how you make them feel.\n‚ãí \nMy goals for this coming year will all revolve around staying true to who I am, and prioritizing my mental and physical  health. To seek more moments of quiet, read more books, be still more AND spend more time in the mountains. And to spend more time with the people I love, and worry less about how it all looks from the outside.\n‚ãí ‚ãí ‚ãí \nI didn‚Äôt add this little original to my shop until now because I‚Äôve loved having it in our home. *update* the original has sold but I‚Äôve linked prints in my bio!! And today is the last day to order from my site to revive things in time for Christmas (contiguous USA) ‚ãí \nWe are (amazingly) ahead of schedule on shipping orders, so we‚Äôre 98% sure we can get your order to you in time if you order by 12/18!

When you decide to take some risks and not be ruled by fear, it opens a lot of doors.\n‚Üü \nNow I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm reckless or to encourage others to be that way-simply that with a bit more bravery, determination, and faith in your own abilities, you can do some pretty cool stuff.\n‚Üü \nAnyways, it‚Äôs crazy to think that just a few years ago at this time of year I was doing all my own packaging, fulfilling all my own orders, hand writing out every address, and in disbelief that people other than my mom liked my artwork. Not much has changed about my gratitude for all of you, but now I have a team to help and a dozen companies I collaborate with to bring more wearable, functional art into the world.\n‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü \nI‚Äôm having a shop update this Wednesday on rachelpohlart.com !! I‚Äôll be releasing a handful of hand painted ornaments, a few of the sold out art bags and chalk bags, as well as a limited number of previously out of stock face masks we found while doing inventory! So mark your calendars for this Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. MST because things will go fast! // #rachelpohlart #mountainart #makersgonnamake",

          "comment": "Not that long ago, we were all kids. And some day, we will be old (if we‚Äôre lucky). Time goes so fast- and it speeds up the older we get. So spend it how you want it, as much as you possibly can.\n‚Üü \nIt‚Äôs funny because most of us are very deliberate with how we spend our money, but less so with our time. Have you ever noticed that? But time is the most valuable currency we have.\n‚Üü \nSo be mindful of when you‚Äôre not spending it wisely- spending time with people who leave you feeing depleted instead of full, spending too long on here wishing your life different, saying yes to the last thing you‚Äôd like to be doing, instead of protecting your time from what doesn‚Äôt serve you...\n‚Üü \nI‚Äôm working on spending my time doing what makes me feel proud of myself, healthy, and happy. On saying no instead of saying yes out of guilt- so I can say yes when it really matters. What about you?\n‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü\n\n@charles_post @mr.knute and I are finally going to get our Christmas tree today!

          "comment": "When I was a freshman in high school, I decided to become a professional artist. I remember having a vague sense of what that actually entailed, but trusting it would all work out.\n‚öò \nWhen I was a freshman in college, I was interviewed for the school paper and when discussing my goals as an artist said ‚ÄúI always want my art to be accessible and affordable people.‚Äù\n‚öò \nAnd years later, I am doing the things both 14 year old and 19 year old Rachel dreamed about. Sure things have been far more challenging than I could have ever dreamed, but also more wonderful. And because dreamed of being an artist for so long, I never take a day of my job for granted. And because I still want to have my work be accessible, I love putting my art on things like stickers and hats and tubes so more people can live a bit more colorfully.\n‚öò ‚öò ‚öò \nThese beauties weren‚Äôt supposed to arrive for at least another week, but @blackstrap_inc made Christmas come early!! I just added these single layer tubes to RACHELPOHLART.com.\nThese are great for skiing, but I wear mine all year round as sun protection, mountain biking etc!\n‚öò \n5 new designs + 3 favorites are back in stock! They are $20 each and made in the USA üá∫üá∏ Click the link in my bio if you‚Äôre looking for some practical, colorful, or meaningful gifts!\n‚öò \nLast day to order everything (besides backpacks and canvas prints- that ship has sailed) for Christmas delivery is tomorrow, but if you order as late as 12/18 we can probably make it happen! Thank you, thank you, thank you all for believing in me and my work. Every little comment, every order, means more than I can say!! Have a happy weekend! #rachelpohlart",

          "comment": "Self care is not selfish, it‚Äôs not an indulgence. It is necessary for your physical and mental health.\n‚öò \nYou don‚Äôt need a bunch of money or leisure time to take care of yourself. And you should not wait until you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it or wait until you‚Äôve taken care of everyone else to think about your needs.\n‚öò \nSelf care CAN be getting a massage, a day at the spa, or hiring a personal trainer. It CAN be a juice cleanse or a facial or a superfood salad- but don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking that‚Äôs what self care is.\n‚öò \nSelf care is saying *no* and protecting your time. It‚Äôs drinking enough water every day and saying no to what makes you feel bad. It‚Äôs eating your favorite meal, taking moments to breathe mindfully, move your body, daydream a bit. It‚Äôs taking time to read a book, watch your favorite show, create, paint, play music.\n‚öò \nSelf care doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive and it doesn‚Äôt have to take more time than you can give to it. Anyone can slip in moments of calm, short periods of joy, and slices of self care when we can- but the first step is saying yes to those windows.\n‚öò \nEverything you need to practice self care is right here. All you need is your brain to stop thinking self care is selfish and a few moments that are just for you, that you carve out whenever you have the chance, because you deserve to make more time for you. Ask for help so you can do more things you love. Tell people no who you don‚Äôt actually want to give your time to.\n‚öò \nIt‚Äôs not an indulgence after all to take care of yourself- it‚Äôs essential to your health and happiness!\n‚öò ‚öò ‚öò \nI‚Äôm SO DELIGHTED to say my yoga mats are officially in stock! There‚Äôs a link to them in my bio or visit RACHELPOHLART.com. Mat and calendar orders will ship next week!!\n‚öò \nAnd because I know this time of year can be hard in many ways, tag a friend who could really use some kindness.\nIn the comments say why they could use a yoga mat this holiday season, and the friend you nominate will be entered to win a free mat of their choice!!

          "comment": "A year ago @charles_post and I bought our first home, nested on ten acres of land near these very mountains.\n‚ãí \nWe are now stewards of this slice of earth, and that has some weight to it. Last summer, we planted trees + native flowers, and our goal is to create even more wildlife habitat and food for pollinators in the years to come.\n‚ãí \nIf you think about it though, regardless of how much land you ‚Äúown,‚Äù we all have access to so much nature- National Parks, National forest, wilderness areas... the health and well-being of these places and the wildlife that inhabit them are our collective responsibility.\n‚ãí \nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to partner with @parksproject because our public lands need our help, now more than ever. Each @parksproject purchase directly contributes to one of 50+ non-profit groups protecting parks and public lands in North America, providing necessary funding for the ongoing care of National Parks and public lands. I‚Äôve admired their company for a long time and I‚Äôm so honored to be able to spread the word about the work they facilitate!!\n‚ãí \nFor example, with every Joshua Tree product sold (like this awesome tee I‚Äôm wearing!) together we support the monitoring and protection of trees in the park. I was lucky enough to climb and paint in Joshua Tree some years ago, and it‚Äôs a special place to me (anyone else been there?)\n‚ãí \nIt saddens me to know that Joshua trees are now struggling to survive. Invasive plants, fire, and climate change are taking an enormous toll. Volunteers and partners work hard to collect data, remove invasive plants, and create fuel breaks to protect a beautiful species that symbolizes California deserts. Like every Park these days, Joshua Tree is in a fragile state. Thankfully, due to the @parksproject partnership, 12,089 hectares of Joshua Tree have been restored!\n‚ãí \nSo if you‚Äôd like to give back to the places that give us so much, check out @parksproject !! Because here we are ALL land owners regardless of if we‚Äôve put down roots,¬†and together we can make a difference for our public lands. // #parksproject #protectwhatyoulove",

          "comment": "I‚Äôm a bit of a gambler... and what I mean by that is I always bet on myself, even against the odds...\n‚Üü \nYou see, with my business I take a lot of risks. I initiate a thought and sort of start making it happen, even if I don‚Äôt know what the outcome will be.\n‚Üü \nAnd honestly things usually work out, though not often in the way I thought they would.¬†Sometimes they are less amazing and sometimes than I‚Äôd hope, sometimes they exceed all expectations. But as I‚Äôve learned to keep those expectations more fluid and less rigid, I‚Äôve become a lot happier- and taken more risks.\n‚Üü \nBecause when you bet on yourself, it‚Äôs up to you to make the magic happen.¬†It‚Äôs up to you to swallow your fear and sometimes your pride in the hopes that big things can happen. When you decide to take some risks and not be ruled by fear, it opens a lot of doors.\n‚Üü \nNow I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm reckless or to encourage others to be that way-simply that with a bit more bravery, determination, and faith in your own abilities, you can do some pretty cool stuff.\n‚Üü \nAnyways, it‚Äôs crazy to think that just a few years ago at this time of year I was doing all my own packaging, fulfilling all my own orders, hand writing out every address, and in disbelief that people other than my mom liked my artwork. Not much has changed about my gratitude for all of you, but now I have a team to help and a dozen companies I collaborate with to bring more wearable, functional art into the world.\n‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü \nI‚Äôm having a shop update this Wednesday on rachelpohlart.com !! I‚Äôll be releasing a handful of hand painted ornaments, a few of the sold out art bags and chalk bags, as well as a limited number of previously out of stock face masks we found while doing inventory! So mark your calendars for this Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. MST because things will go fast! // #rachelpohlart #mountainart #makersgonnamake",

          "comment": "I‚Äôm proud to say that almost every photo I‚Äôve posted in the past few months is from our property or in nearby mountains.\n‚Üü \nI used to dream of traveling, of always being somewhere enviable- and that‚Äôs what I did for a while. But I rarely felt content- just restless. I was always trying to be somewhere else, to prove something, and definitely to escape from my feelings...\n‚Üü \nAnd now that @charles_post and I are almost always home, after so many years of never being fully happy, I‚Äôve realized that you can be happy or unhappy anywhere. You have to take the time to do the deep work, and traveling can honestly make that process take a lot longer if you‚Äôre just checking off bucket list places instead of actually taking the time to BE somewhere (which can help us grow a lot).\n‚Üü \nBecause no matter how amazing life looks on the outside, it‚Äôs how you feel inside that counts.\n‚Üü \nMy happiness has increased so much since I decided to just be myself. Not some Instagram travel influencer, but an artist. An athlete. A Montana girl who kinda just wants to be in Montana. Really, just a person who wants to live the best life I can and help others do the same.\n‚Üü \nSo while I don‚Äôt know just where I‚Äôm going with my business, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll want to travel more some day, I know I‚Äôm going to be home a lot more, grow inwards and stop distracting myself with what doesn‚Äôt really improve my life. I‚Äôm going to just enjoy my time with @charles_post and @mr.knute because they, more than anything else, help my happiness grow by the day.\n‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü \nMy final shop update before the holidays is tomorrow (Wednesday) at 3 p.m. MST. I‚Äôm so excited to share a ton of new goodies and get some out of stock favorites back in stock (in limited quantities!) Thank you for all the love this holiday season, it means more than I can say to our little family! // #rachelpohlart #mrknute #happytears #ahsaunas",

I remember having a vague sense of what that actually entailed, but trusting it would all work out.\n‚öò \nWhen I was a freshman in college, I was interviewed for the school paper and when discussing my goals as an artist said ‚ÄúI always want my art to be accessible and affordable people.‚Äù\n‚öò \nAnd years later, I am doing the things both 14 year old and 19 year old Rachel dreamed about. Sure things have been far more challenging than I could have ever dreamed, but also more wonderful. And because dreamed of being an artist for so long, I never take a day of my job for granted. And because I still want to have my work be accessible, I love putting my art on things like stickers and hats and tubes so more people can live a bit more colorfully.\n‚öò ‚öò ‚öò \nThese beauties weren‚Äôt supposed to arrive for at least another week, but @blackstrap_inc made Christmas come early!! I just added these single layer tubes to RACHELPOHLART.com.\nThese are great for skiing, but I wear mine all year round as sun protection, mountain biking etc!\n‚öò \n5 new designs + 3 favorites are back in stock! They are $20 each and made in the USA üá∫üá∏ Click the link in my bio if you‚Äôre looking for some practical, colorful, or meaningful gifts!\n‚öò \nLast day to order everything (besides backpacks and canvas prints- that ship has sailed) for Christmas delivery is tomorrow, but if you order as late as 12/18 we can probably make it happen! Thank you, thank you, thank you all for believing in me and my work. Every little comment, every order, means more than I can say!! Have a happy weekend! #rachelpohlart",

To seek more moments of quiet, read more books, be still more AND spend more time in the mountains. And to spend more time with the people I love, and worry less about how it all looks from the outside.\n‚ãí ‚ãí ‚ãí \nI didn‚Äôt add this little original to my shop until now because I‚Äôve loved having it in our home. *update* the original has sold but I‚Äôve linked prints in my bio!!

So spend it how you want it, as much as you possibly can.\n‚Üü \nIt‚Äôs funny because most of us are very deliberate with how we spend our money, but less so with our time. Have you ever noticed that? But time is the most valuable currency we have.\n‚Üü \nSo be mindful of when you‚Äôre not spending it wisely- spending time with people who leave you feeing depleted instead of full, spending too long on here wishing your life different, saying yes to the last thing you‚Äôd like to be doing, instead of protecting your time from what doesn‚Äôt serve you...\n‚Üü \nI‚Äôm working on spending my time doing what makes me feel proud of myself, healthy, and happy. On saying no instead of saying yes out of guilt- so I can say yes when it really matters. What about you?\n‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü\n\n@charles_post @mr.knute and I are finally going to get our Christmas tree today!

          "comment": "Want to know something funny?\n‚ùÖ \nI didn‚Äôt share any of my art on here for a long while, then only occasionally. I was certainly pursuing a career as an artist, I just didn‚Äôt think this was a very important place to help that happen. It also made me feel vulnerable sharing my work with an audience I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know‚Äù- what if people didn‚Äôt like my art? What if they liked it but I knew I could do better??\n‚ùÖ \nBut if we wait until our work (whatever that may be) is perfect before sharing it with the world, we might never do so.\n‚ùÖ \nMy art business didn‚Äôt really flourish until I started really putting myself out there, began pouring my time and effort into my art AND sharing it. I realized the power of this platform then figured out how to grow my following- through just being myself and A LOT of effort.\n‚ùÖ \nSo my advice today is this: if there‚Äôs something you want to pursue, don‚Äôt wait for years like I did to share it with the world! Just start and don‚Äôt care so much about what *everyone* thinks. And if you put in the time on your craft and business, you too can make a career out of what you love. And no instagram is not the only way to make that happen! It has just been a really helpful tool for me to reach an audience :) ‚ùÖ ‚ùÖ ‚ùÖ\n‚ÄúWinter Flatirons‚Äù original on barn wood is up on my site and linked in my bio- if this special piece strikes your fancy, we can ship it out in the next few hours in time for Christmas!

          "comment": "The days are now getting longer... though personally, I love the darkness.\n‚ãí \nI love the cold, deep snow, and starry nights. I long for winter in the summer. I know I‚Äôm the opposite from many people, and it doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense why I prefer short, bitter cold days to long, hot ones.\n‚ãí \nMaybe it was how I was raised, maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been skiing for 25 years and it‚Äôs still my favorite thing to do.\n‚ãí \nBut maybe it‚Äôs because I tend to expect so much from myself, and the darkness gives me an excuse to rest more. In summer I become frustrated by the length of days, the heat, the general ‚Äúhurry up and get all the summer activities in‚Äù feeling. But winter says ‚Äúrest, recalibrate, create.‚Äù\n‚ãí \nThis is my season. The light, the alpenglow on snowy peaks, the color of quickening shadows, the contrast between beautiful sparkly days in the mountains and being tucked in beneath the stars at night, between cold that takes your breath away and a fire that warms your bones.\n‚ãí \nMaybe I need to learn a thing or two from people who love summer- and maybe if you don‚Äôt love winter you can learn a thing or two from this perspective: without darkness, long summer days are so much less special. Without cold, the warmth of summer means less. Without the hard moments in our lives, we feel less gratitude for the truly great ones.\n‚ãí \nSo try to appreciate all the seasons, especially the season you‚Äôre in right now- even if it‚Äôs not your favorite. Everything is always changing- learn to see the beauty in that.\n‚ãí \nHappy (belated) solstice to all of you!\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n#rachelpohlart #solstice #wintersolstice #tetons #grandtetonnationalpark #mountaingirls #mountainlife #livecolorfully #alpenglow #nordicspirit #creativehappylife #winterismyseason #winterwonderland",

Though we don‚Äôt have much snow and the skiing has been far from amazing, we‚Äôve still been getting out every day on little logging roads in a canyon near our home- because that‚Äôs what makes us happy.

Let go of trying to be everything to everyone, all the time.\n‚Üü \nLet go of the past- good or bad. Of trying to always prove something. Let go of labeling yourself and others. Of blaming and shaming and judging. Of thinking you‚Äôre not good enough. Let go of thinking ‚Äúwhen ____ happens I‚Äôll be happy.‚Äù\n‚Üü \nLet go of controlling everything. Let go of wishing you or the people around you were different. Let go of caring what strangers think, and of measuring your worth against them.\n‚Üü \nLet go of good vs evil, black and white, right or wrong- and instead embrace other opinions and nuances.\n‚Üü ‚Üü \nLet go of trying to *let go* perfectly. Because letting go is about release, not rejection. It‚Äôs about not holding on so tightly...\n‚Üü \nBecause once you start to let go, you‚Äôll find you‚Äôve been free all along. Because when you learn to move past which does not serve you (that you‚Äôre clutching onto so tightly) you can reach for what lights you up.\n‚Üü ‚Üü ‚Üü \nThis photo from a little nordic ski with @charles_post @mr.knute a few days ago sums up letting go of so much... and embracing the little happy moments that fill me up. Happy last day of the decade everyone!\n‚Üü \nWhat are you letting go of this year?",

          "comment": "It didn‚Äôt happen overnight. I didn‚Äôt just wake up one day with an art career, a husband, a dog, a house, and all of this.\n‚ãí \nTen years ago I graduated from high school with some big dreams of being an artist. Over the last decade I‚Äôve fought so hard for everything I have. At times I fought for my health, both mental and physical. At others I had to stand up to people and circumstances that threatened my dreams. I worked as a nanny and babysat for a long long time before I could support myself on my art. Since then, I traveled to a dozen counties and I‚Äôve already grown my business far beyond my wildest dreams... I married the man of my dreams and got a pup that loves the snow and cold as much as we do...\n‚ãí \nBut my greatest success in the last ten years is not what I‚Äôve acquired, accomplished, or where I‚Äôve traveled- but who I‚Äôve become. The peace I‚Äôve found in accepting who I am has allowed me to create a life I‚Äôm proud of and not one bound by other‚Äôs expectations.\n‚ãí \nI‚Äôm really excited for the next ten years. I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to become even more ‚Äúme.‚Äù Set goals you guys- it works. People who don‚Äôt set goals don‚Äôt expect enough from themselves. Be disciplined, don‚Äôt worry if you change your dreams, but don‚Äôt be afraid to make things happen, make mistakes, make some magic.\n‚ãí \nWhat are your intentions for this year and the next decade??\n‚ãí ‚ãí ‚ãí \nPhoto by @charles_post #adventuresamoyeds #hikingwithdogs #skiingwithdogs #mrknute #backcountryskiing #2020 #intentions #creativehappylife #artistslife",

BUT I‚Äôm not a huge fan of gifting just for the sake of gifting (and the waste that can come along with that). Instead, I‚Äôm a big believer in spending meaningful time with your loved ones over the holidays... and if you and your friends/family also give physical gifts, get them high-quality items that they can love for years to come. I just wrote a blog post all about meaningful holiday experiences you can have with your loved ones these holidays, especially outdoor adventures! In the guide I also included a range of high-quality items you can gift the outdoor lover in your life, all with a focus on supporting sustainable and ethical brands. Click the link in my bio to have a read!\n‚†Ä\nThis gifting guide is in collaboration with @Backcountry. For years now they have been my go-to online retailer for purchasing gear so that I can make these meaningful outdoor adventures happen. I love that they partner with a range of sustainable brands, support incredible causes like The Nature Conservancy, and their amazing Gearheads are always available to give advice and recommendations.

I‚Äôve worn these @IcebreakerNZ layers countless times over the past few months and have only washed them twice üò∂ Before you run away thinking I‚Äôm a disgusting stinky person, hear me out! For years now I‚Äôve been a big fan of Icebreaker‚Äôs layers made from natural fibers. They are breathable, comfortable to wear, practical for outdoor and casual adventures, AND they don‚Äôt get smelly! The natural thermoregulation of merino wool means I don‚Äôt sweat as much, and when I do the fibers naturally suppress odor build up... therefore less need for laundry! This in turn is better for the environment and it‚Äôs also super convenient when traveling. Having layering pieces means I‚Äôm always able to switch items out depending on the conditions, keeping me cool when I need it and warm when the temp drops ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è #IcebreakerPartner #MoveToNatural #Icebreaker",

The funny thing is, I regularly have forced social media breaks throughout the year - e.g. when I‚Äôm in the backcountry, on a long haul flight, or in a remote location. But that‚Äôs the difference, those instances are forced and not really my choice to make. I never mindlessly reach for my phone in those circumstances, yet in every day life I find myself unconsciously scrolling and using social media as a source of distraction üì± There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with that, but I just didn‚Äôt like that it had become such an ingrained habit. During my break I found that it wasn‚Äôt really until day 3 that I stopped mindlessly clicking on my favorite social media apps (usually IG or Twitter). I literally didn‚Äôt even realize I was doing it until the app would open up... isn‚Äôt that crazy?! It‚Äôs such an automatic behavior ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm obviously back online now, but moving forward I do want to keep remembering to be as mindful as possible about what I‚Äôm consuming on social media. I‚Äôm not necessarily limiting my app usage, but I am catching myself when I start scrolling for no real reason other than for distraction or procrastination. Whats the longest you‚Äôve ever had a social media break for? Did it change the way you use the apps?",

          "comment": "YOUR MOST ASKED QUESTIONS ‚ú® I love hearing from you guys, but I do get a lot of the same questions pop up in my DMs and comments... SO I have decided to do a little series of posts answering your most asked questions!\n‚†Ä\nüì∑ PART 1 üì∑ Q: How do you take selfies? / Who takes your photos?\n‚†Ä\nA: My husband, @MatthewHahnel, takes the majority of my portraits. We run our business together, he is open to me directing him on the kind of photo I want, and we have learned how to work well together over the years.\n‚†Ä\nIn saying that, you don‚Äôt need an Instagram husband to take beautiful self portraits üòâ I have learned a thing or two over the years about taking solo selfies. Here are my top tipsüëáüèº\n‚†Ä\n{Save this post to refer to later}\n‚ú®Invest in a tripod. Yes, they are kind of awkward to travel with but they make taking self portraits WAY easier.\n‚ú®Use the self timer function of your camera (some also have built in intervalometers), or use a remote control shutter release.\n‚ú®Before you run into frame, use a prop (like your backpack) to focus your camera on something where you will be standing. This will avoid any out-of-focus shots.\n‚ú®You can also ask someone to take the photo for you! Make it as easy as possible by setting up the shot for them. Obviously use your judgment and be careful about who you pass your camera over to.\n‚ú®Try not be to embarrassed. Yes, you probably look quite silly standing there posing in front of a tripod. But does it matter what those people around you think? You‚Äôll probably never see them again...\n‚ú®Try using a prop if you‚Äôre a little awkward. This will give you something to do with your hands and could be as simple as using your jacket, hat, or bag.\n‚ú®Go when the crowds are smallest. This usually means getting up early!\n‚†Ä\nThat‚Äôs all IG will give me room to write! You‚Äôll find more tips on my blog (link in bio) üíõ\n‚†Ä\nImportant: Don‚Äôt be an asshole when trying to take your selfies. Always be kind and respectful, share the location, and offer to help others get their shots (i.e. be a good human).",

BUT I‚Äôm not a huge fan of gifting just for the sake of gifting (and the waste that can come along with that). Instead, I‚Äôm a big believer in spending meaningful time with your loved ones over the holidays... and if you and your friends/family also give physical gifts, get them high-quality items that they can love for years to come. I just wrote a blog post all about meaningful holiday experiences you can have with your loved ones these holidays, especially outdoor adventures! In the guide I also included a range of high-quality items you can gift the outdoor lover in your life, all with a focus on supporting sustainable and ethical brands. Click the link in my bio to have a read!\n‚†Ä\nThis gifting guide is in collaboration with @Backcountry. For years now they have been my go-to online retailer for purchasing gear so that I can make these meaningful outdoor adventures happen. I love that they partner with a range of sustainable brands, support incredible causes like The Nature Conservancy, and their amazing Gearheads are always available to give advice and recommendations.

I‚Äôve worn these @IcebreakerNZ layers countless times over the past few months and have only washed them twice üò∂ Before you run away thinking I‚Äôm a disgusting stinky person, hear me out! For years now I‚Äôve been a big fan of Icebreaker‚Äôs layers made from natural fibers. They are breathable, comfortable to wear, practical for outdoor and casual adventures, AND they don‚Äôt get smelly! The natural thermoregulation of merino wool means I don‚Äôt sweat as much, and when I do the fibers naturally suppress odor build up... therefore less need for laundry! This in turn is better for the environment and it‚Äôs also super convenient when traveling. Having layering pieces means I‚Äôm always able to switch items out depending on the conditions, keeping me cool when I need it and warm when the temp drops ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è #IcebreakerPartner #MoveToNatural #Icebreaker",

The funny thing is, I regularly have forced social media breaks throughout the year - e.g. when I‚Äôm in the backcountry, on a long haul flight, or in a remote location. But that‚Äôs the difference, those instances are forced and not really my choice to make. I never mindlessly reach for my phone in those circumstances, yet in every day life I find myself unconsciously scrolling and using social media as a source of distraction üì± There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with that, but I just didn‚Äôt like that it had become such an ingrained habit. During my break I found that it wasn‚Äôt really until day 3 that I stopped mindlessly clicking on my favorite social media apps (usually IG or Twitter). I literally didn‚Äôt even realize I was doing it until the app would open up... isn‚Äôt that crazy?! It‚Äôs such an automatic behavior ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm obviously back online now, but moving forward I do want to keep remembering to be as mindful as possible about what I‚Äôm consuming on social media. I‚Äôm not necessarily limiting my app usage, but I am catching myself when I start scrolling for no real reason other than for distraction or procrastination. Whats the longest you‚Äôve ever had a social media break for? Did it change the way you use the apps?",

With over 12 million acres burned so far, nearly half a billion animals dead, and even human lives lost, these fires are beyond devastating. This week, I‚Äôll be donating 75% of sales on my print site to @wildliferescue.sunshinecoast to go towards Australia‚Äôs remaining wildlife. It‚Äôs not much, but every little bit adds up! So grab a print and help Australia‚Äôs amazing volunteers. And if you‚Äôd rather just donate directly, consider some of the following options:\n@wildliferescue.sunshinecoast\n@redcrossau\n@wireswildliferescue\n@cfavic\n*Photos showing a few of the prints available - link to more in bio*",

I don‚Äôt buy bejeweled lingerie, wear feathered wings in the bedroom or have stems a mile long. I literally could not NOT relate to anything more.\n\nBut regardless of how I feel, the brand was finally called out for their unrealistic, unattainable and demoralizing beauty standards. So, they‚Äôve closed up shop on their big event. They‚Äôve yet to admit to the public that it‚Äôs because they know they need to redirect their marketing to more body inclusive... but baby steps.\n\nSo tonight, go love on some ladies who are the real super models of life. #normalizenormalbodies #victoriasecretfashionshow #everybodyisbeatiful #effyourbeautystandards #ihaveembraced\n\nPhoto by @kellylemon",

          "comment": "Today my best little guy left us. Leo, you were so loved by the world and had so many friends, costumes, experiences and snacks! You were the king of @72andsunny_, you had your 15 seconds of fame on The Bachelor, you had the wickedest farts. You loved the beach, sleeping in my bed, going for car rides, your brother & sister, your aunties @jessdbrewer, @aahlixx and uncle @Rebeccaullman, and you hated the boys who broke my heart and getting your nails clipped.\n\nYou were so good to me and everyone‚Äôs lives you touched. I only hope I was as good to you. My heart is broken selfishly for the loss of you in my life, but relieved you will no longer be in pain. Thank you for bringing so much frenchie joy to the world during your short time here.\n\nMay you rest playfully on a dog beach with all of your friends and fans. Please no questions, only condolences and memories. üôèüèª",

Wrote one-deleted it.\n\nThey feel like fad diets you‚Äôre committed to for 30 days and then you‚Äôre just like, ‚Äúwhy am I drinking celery juice every morning? I hate celery juice.‚Äù BTW - if you‚Äôve already given up your celery juice cleanse, or had a glass of wine, or eaten bread, or skipped your workout like you SWORE you wouldn‚Äôt... no fret, you‚Äôve come to the right place.\n\nHere‚Äôs something radical I‚Äôm going to try in 2020 that you might want to try, too...\nnot setting any resolutions (gasp!) and forgiving yourself for the ones you did make, but couldn‚Äôt keep... because unrealistic goals are tough.\n\nInstead, try holding space for yourself. Take classes, make art, stretch your muscles and your mind. Spend a day on the couch or hike a mountain. Finish a project or start a new one. Eat a salad or eat a cheeseburger. Skinny dip in an alpine lake or wear cozies all day long.\n\nDo whatever makes you, more YOU. There is no timeline for becoming you. And if it doesn‚Äôt happen in 2020, who cares. each day is a new day.\n\nPhoto by @dylan.h.brown\n\n#selflovejourney #mentalhealthawareness #growthmindset #bereal #authenticity #newyearsresolutions #womenwhohike #ihaveembraced #womenwhohikecolorado #sawtoothmountains #goatlake #optoutside #sheadventures #normalizenormalbodies #idahome",

          "comment": "When people watch me tie my shoes (or do any other two-handed tasks, like, opening a water bottle, painting my fingernails, typing on a keyboard, zipping my coat or putting a bag into the over-head bin) the general sentiment is to tell me how amazing I am.\n\nI‚Äôm not bothered by this, though I know many people with physical differences are.\n\nStrangers telling you how amazing you are for performing every-day, mundane tasks can feel patronizing and humiliating, when all you‚Äôre trying to do is NOT stand out for once.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing... it IS amazing! It‚Äôs amazing that humans are built to adapt and are wired for resiliency.\n\nIt‚Äôs amazing that we get to own our stories and use them to start conversations, build human connection and demonstrate compassion.\n\nIt‚Äôs amazing to teach, to share, to normalize and to humanize the daily life a person with a physical difference.\n\nI know many of you may not agree with me. And that‚Äôs OK. It takes time. But just know, the next time someone calls you ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù or tells you how ‚Äúamazing‚Äù you are... believe it! You have no idea what one person considers amazing or who‚Äôs life you might ACTUALLY inspire just by being YOU.\n\nThank you @lesleyannemurphy for encouraging me to share this video, and all the girls in the Bachelor mansion who wanted to learn how I painted my nails before rose ceremonies üòâüíÖüèº",

Instagram doesn‚Äôt offer a bereavement policy, because grief is uncomfortable ‚Äì especially when it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs grief in your feed. Yuck.\n\nI know eventually the veil will be lifted, and I‚Äôll have to get back to some regularly scheduled sponsored posts and inspirational quotes ‚Äì I mean, cute outfits don‚Äôt make themselves! ‚Äì but in the meantime, I wanted to share my healing with you because that‚Äôs the only thing that feels honest right now.\n\nIf you lost a loved one over this Holiday season, you‚Äôre not alone. I feel how hard it is to open this app and pretend everything is normal.\n\nSo here‚Äôs an excerpt I love from @noraborealis that might comfort you or someone who‚Äôs experiencing grief. ‚ÄúGrief is kind of one of those things,¬†like, falling in love or having a baby or watching \"The Wire\" on HBO,¬†where you don't get it until you get it, until you do it.¬†And once you do it, once it's your love or your baby,¬†once it's your grief and your front row at the funeral,¬†you get it.¬†You understand what you're experiencing is not a moment in time,¬†it's not a bone that will reset,¬†but that you've been touched by something chronic.¬†Something incurable.¬†It's not fatal, but sometimes grief feels like it could be.¬†And if we can't prevent it in one another,¬†what can we do?\n\nWhat can we do other than try to remind one another¬†that some things can't be fixed,¬†and not all wounds are meant to heal?¬†We need each other to remember ‚Äì to help each other remember,¬†that grief is this multitasking emotion.¬†That you can and will be sad, and happy; you'll be grieving, and able to love¬†in the same year or week, the same breath.¬†We need to remember that a grieving person is going to laugh again and smile again.¬†If they're lucky, they'll even find love again.¬†But yes, absolutely, they're going to move forward.¬†But that doesn't mean that they've moved on‚Äù",

What if I don‚Äôt summit? What if the eating disorder voice inside said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to this trip so it could hijack me into losing weight? What if I‚Äôm doing this because it seems like ‚Äúthe thing‚Äù the brave, one-armed-adventure-girl who can do anything is supposed to do? What if I‚Äôm actually not capable of conquering any obstacle that stands in my way? What if I‚Äôm the biggest fraud of the century and I just signed myself up to be exposed?\n\nI know these thoughts aren‚Äôt reality, and I know that I have the tools to redirect them.\n\nWhat‚Äôs important for anyone who encounters little brain monsters like this, is to recognize when they show up, be aware of their power, and make peace with them.\n\nI know it‚Äôs possible that I might not summit, and it‚Äôs possible that I could have a very mentally challenging time with this experience. But I also know how to work through each battle with the self-compassion, and relinquish my control of this journey.\n\nIn 30 days I head out for Kilimanjaro. And while I‚Äôm nervous for the challenge ahead, I‚Äôm at peace knowing whether or not I summit, my experience will be authentically, me.\n\nStay tuned over the next several weeks as I share everything I‚Äôm doing to prepare, including training outdoors in the winter, and what I‚Äôll be bringing along from @backcountry!\n_\n\n#findyourbackcountry #sponsored",

          "comment": "For years - especially in my 20‚Äôs - I thought the only thing people found interesting about me was that I was ‚Äúthe girl born with one arm.‚Äù I was actually convinced it was the only reason I was cast on The Bachelor.\n\nFor better or worse, the one thing that made me unique, also felt like an identity trap. I couldn‚Äôt see the bigger picture.\n\nBut after A LOT of reflection (aka, self-help books, therapy and community sharing) I‚Äôve come to better understand and accept that the way I look - or in this case my arm - is the absolute least interesting thing about me - now it‚Äôs just icing on the cake üòâ\n\nWe trick ourselves into believing that the one thing we can‚Äôt un-see in the mirror (fat, skinny, boobs, no boobs, zits, body hair etc...) is the ONLY thing other‚Äôs see when they think of us.\n\nBut the most interesting things about you aren‚Äôt those surface layer, characteristics that only YOU fixate on.\n\nThe reason people love you has nothing to do with how much you weigh, or how many whiteheads are on your face, or if you have hair on your chin. They love you and are drawn to you because you contain multitudes of interesting qualities and values! Like your creativity, your sense of humor, your contagiously positive energy, your selflessness, and your authenticity.\n\nSo the next time you are feeling down on yourself for the way you look, remember your appearance is only a small percentage of who you are as a person. You are so much more.\n\nTag a friend below and tell them why you think they are interesting! \n#embraceyourself #youarebeatiful #lovewhoyouare #learntoloveyourself #selfacceptance #selflove",

          "comment": "The first year Dylan and I were dating, he asked me to do something FAR outside of my comfort zone - he asked me to run away for Christmas and sail the islands of San Blas, Panama. I had never NOT celebrated Christmas, or been away from my family - let alone over seas with a new boyfriend - so this proposal had me riddled with uncomfortable firsts.\n\nI had so much fear surrounding this trip it nearly broke Dylan and I up, as he saw I was beginning to crack under my tough girl facade. He was inviting me along to sail with him from Panama to Colombia over the course of 8 days and I had never even left the continent. I was told I could only pack what would fit in my backpack and one swim suit. (‚ÄúYeah right,‚Äù thought). So of course I started researching what this sail would entail and the first blog I came across was a top hit titled ‚Äúhow NOT to sail San Blas.‚Äù I read the woman‚Äôs account of being sardine packed on a 6 person sail boat with 12 other backpackers and fed nothing but crackers and rum for 7 days without seeing land. The woman endured bed bugs, sea sickness, sun stroke and stolen possessions. Panic kicked in.\n\nInsecurity began to muster up every excuse it could for reasons why I shouldn‚Äôt go on this trip. I was convinced I was not cut out for this type of travel - I was a 5 star hotel kinda girl. To put my anxieties at ease, we worked together to book an experience that would be a compromise of adventure and comfort. We ended up getting lucky and found a lovely French couple that was chartering their boat through San Blas and has it listed on Airbnb. We had the boat all to ourselves and still had the rum ;) What followed were the most magical 7 days at sea, island hoping from one untouched sand bar to the next.\n\nThough this trip terrified me in theory, it pushed me past my comfort zone and ended up becoming the start of my love for travel. It taught me it‚Äôs OK to choose yourself over the holidays and go on the adventure you want. It taught me it‚Äôs OK to wash your hair in the ocean, and let go of your expectations.\n\nI hope you all get to round out your year and welcome the new with something that pushes you out of your comfort zone, too. ‚úåüèª",

          "comment": "@lesleyannemurphy and I are finally doing it! We're finally planning an epic adventure this winter. #ad How has it taken this long!? We've both been traveling the world, watching one another's adventures from afar. Currently, I've been backpacking in Utah, while Lesley has been exploring the South Pacific - but we have yet to travel together again.\n\nAnd, since we both have the @BankofAmerica Travel Rewards Visa¬Æ credit card, we decided to redeem our points toward this trip after we get home. The @BankofAmerica Travel Rewards Visa¬Æ credit card offers 1.5 points per $1 on all purchases and I earn even more because I'm a Preferred Rewards member, soo .. we have a friendly competition going to see who can earn the most points. (I think I have this one in the bag since I've already started my holiday shopping). I first met @lesleyannemurphy 7 years ago as I was stepping out of a limo ride that would forever change my life - she was the small town girl who had explored the world, carried a football while wearing a ballgown, and made me feel like the whole \"journey\" ahead of us wasn't going to be so frightening after all. For the next several weeks we traveled the country, dated the same guy (weird), and shared experiences that can only be described as \"one of a kind.\" Excited for this adventure together!\n\nBut now the big question remains ... Where should we go?! Leave us your suggestions in the comments - we're looking for adventure, hiking, camping, glamping, and lots of exploring here in the U.S. We'll announce where we decide in our stories this week.

          "comment": "If you‚Äôre like me, you probably had no idea that tonight was SUPPOSED to be the Victoria‚Äôs Secret fashion show - but it was canceled.\n\nI‚Äôve never watched this fashion event, because I never understood the point - and I‚Äôm not a masochist. I don‚Äôt buy bejeweled lingerie, wear feathered wings in the bedroom or have stems a mile long. I literally could not NOT relate to anything more.\n\nBut regardless of how I feel, the brand was finally called out for their unrealistic, unattainable and demoralizing beauty standards. So, they‚Äôve closed up shop on their big event. They‚Äôve yet to admit to the public that it‚Äôs because they know they need to redirect their marketing to more body inclusive... but baby steps.\n\nSo tonight, go love on some ladies who are the real super models of life. #normalizenormalbodies #victoriasecretfashionshow #everybodyisbeatiful #effyourbeautystandards #ihaveembraced\n\nPhoto by @kellylemon",

For example, they start including a lot more clothing, the parties move from the club to the slopes and several days go by before you even think to share it to Instagram.\n\nBut one thing that stays the same is hot pink tights.\n\nI had a wonderful, low-key birthday spent doing my favorite thing in the world, with one of my favorite humans. Thank you ALL for making me feel so loved.\n\nOF COURSE I have lots to share about my year of growth and reflection (boy was this year a doozy!) but we‚Äôll save that for when I‚Äôm ready to get deep again.

It‚Äôs amazing that humans are built to adapt and are wired for resiliency.\n\nIt‚Äôs amazing that we get to own our stories and use them to start conversations, build human connection and demonstrate compassion.\n\nIt‚Äôs amazing to teach, to share, to normalize and to humanize the daily life a person with a physical difference.\n\nI know many of you may not agree with me. And that‚Äôs OK. It takes time. But just know, the next time someone calls you ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù or tells you how ‚Äúamazing‚Äù you are... believe it! You have no idea what one person considers amazing or who‚Äôs life you might ACTUALLY inspire just by being YOU.\n\nThank you @lesleyannemurphy for encouraging me to share this video, and all the girls in the Bachelor mansion who wanted to learn how I painted my nails before rose ceremonies üòâüíÖüèº",

Currently, I've been backpacking in Utah, while Lesley has been exploring the South Pacific - but we have yet to travel together again.\n\nAnd, since we both have the @BankofAmerica Travel Rewards Visa¬Æ credit card, we decided to redeem our points toward this trip after we get home. The @BankofAmerica Travel Rewards Visa¬Æ credit card offers 1.5 points per $1 on all purchases and I earn even more because I'm a Preferred Rewards member, soo .. we have a friendly competition going to see who can earn the most points. (I think I have this one in the bag since I've already started my holiday shopping). I first met @lesleyannemurphy 7 years ago as I was stepping out of a limo ride that would forever change my life - she was the small town girl who had explored the world, carried a football while wearing a ballgown, and made me feel like the whole \"journey\" ahead of us wasn't going to be so frightening after all. For the next several weeks we traveled the country, dated the same guy (weird), and shared experiences that can only be described as \"one of a kind.\" Excited for this adventure together!\n\nBut now the big question remains ... Where should we go?! Leave us your suggestions in the comments - we're looking for adventure, hiking, camping, glamping, and lots of exploring here in the U.S. We'll announce where we decide in our stories this week. Check out the link in my bio to learn more!",

Adventures with you have included countless countries, thousands of miles by land, sky and sea, numerous nights under the stars, half a dozen hiking boots worn through and a lifetimes worth of pizza slices. You‚Äôre my best friend, my creative partner and now the papa to our puppy. Happy Birthday, thank you for letting me celebrate you - even though you hate the attention. ü•Çto another year in this crazy life together.",

You were the king of @72andsunny_, you had your 15 seconds of fame on The Bachelor, you had the wickedest farts. You loved the beach, sleeping in my bed, going for car rides, your brother & sister, your aunties @jessdbrewer, @aahlixx and uncle @Rebeccaullman, and you hated the boys who broke my heart and getting your nails clipped.\n\nYou were so good to me and everyone‚Äôs lives you touched. I only hope I was as good to you. My heart is broken selfishly for the loss of you in my life, but relieved you will no longer be in pain. Thank you for bringing so much frenchie joy to the world during your short time here.\n\nMay you rest playfully on a dog beach with all of your friends and fans. Please no questions, only condolences and memories. üôèüèª",

Instagram doesn‚Äôt offer a bereavement policy, because grief is uncomfortable ‚Äì especially when it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs grief in your feed. Yuck.\n\nI know eventually the veil will be lifted, and I‚Äôll have to get back to some regularly scheduled sponsored posts and inspirational quotes ‚Äì I mean, cute outfits don‚Äôt make themselves! ‚Äì but in the meantime, I wanted to share my healing with you because that‚Äôs the only thing that feels honest right now.\n\nIf you lost a loved one over this Holiday season, you‚Äôre not alone. I feel how hard it is to open this app and pretend everything is normal.\n\nSo here‚Äôs an excerpt I love from @noraborealis that might comfort you or someone who‚Äôs experiencing grief. ‚ÄúGrief is kind of one of those things,¬†like, falling in love or having a baby or watching \"The Wire\" on HBO,¬†where you don't get it until you get it, until you do it.¬†And once you do it, once it's your love or your baby,¬†once it's your grief and your front row at the funeral,¬†you get it.¬†You understand what you're experiencing is not a moment in time,¬†it's not a bone that will reset,¬†but that you've been touched by something chronic.¬†Something incurable.¬†It's not fatal, but sometimes grief feels like it could be.¬†And if we can't prevent it in one another,¬†what can we do?\n\nWhat can we do other than try to remind one another¬†that some things can't be fixed,¬†and not all wounds are meant to heal?¬†We need each other to remember ‚Äì to help each other remember,¬†that grief is this multitasking emotion.¬†That you can and will be sad, and happy; you'll be grieving, and able to love¬†in the same year or week, the same breath.¬†We need to remember that a grieving person is going to laugh again and smile again.¬†If they're lucky, they'll even find love again.¬†But yes, absolutely, they're going to move forward.¬†But that doesn't mean that they've moved on‚Äù",

What if I don‚Äôt summit? What if the eating disorder voice inside said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to this trip so it could hijack me into losing weight? What if I‚Äôm doing this because it seems like ‚Äúthe thing‚Äù the brave, one-armed-adventure-girl who can do anything is supposed to do? What if I‚Äôm actually not capable of conquering any obstacle that stands in my way? What if I‚Äôm the biggest fraud of the century and I just signed myself up to be exposed?\n\nI know these thoughts aren‚Äôt reality, and I know that I have the tools to redirect them.\n\nWhat‚Äôs important for anyone who encounters little brain monsters like this, is to recognize when they show up, be aware of their power, and make peace with them.\n\nI know it‚Äôs possible that I might not summit, and it‚Äôs possible that I could have a very mentally challenging time with this experience. But I also know how to work through each battle with the self-compassion, and relinquish my control of this journey.\n\nIn 30 days I head out for Kilimanjaro. And while I‚Äôm nervous for the challenge ahead, I‚Äôm at peace knowing whether or not I summit, my experience will be authentically, me.\n\nStay tuned over the next several weeks as I share everything I‚Äôm doing to prepare, including training outdoors in the winter, and what I‚Äôll be bringing along from @backcountry!\n_\n\n#findyourbackcountry #sponsored",

          "comment": "For years - especially in my 20‚Äôs - I thought the only thing people found interesting about me was that I was ‚Äúthe girl born with one arm.‚Äù I was actually convinced it was the only reason I was cast on The Bachelor.\n\nFor better or worse, the one thing that made me unique, also felt like an identity trap. I couldn‚Äôt see the bigger picture.\n\nBut after A LOT of reflection (aka, self-help books, therapy and community sharing) I‚Äôve come to better understand and accept that the way I look - or in this case my arm - is the absolute least interesting thing about me - now it‚Äôs just icing on the cake üòâ\n\nWe trick ourselves into believing that the one thing we can‚Äôt un-see in the mirror (fat, skinny, boobs, no boobs, zits, body hair etc...) is the ONLY thing other‚Äôs see when they think of us.\n\nBut the most interesting things about you aren‚Äôt those surface layer, characteristics that only YOU fixate on.\n\nThe reason people love you has nothing to do with how much you weigh, or how many whiteheads are on your face, or if you have hair on your chin. They love you and are drawn to you because you contain multitudes of interesting qualities and values! Like your creativity, your sense of humor, your contagiously positive energy, your selflessness, and your authenticity.\n\nSo the next time you are feeling down on yourself for the way you look, remember your appearance is only a small percentage of who you are as a person. You are so much more.\n\nTag a friend below and tell them why you think they are interesting! \n#embraceyourself #youarebeatiful #lovewhoyouare #learntoloveyourself #selfacceptance #selflove",

Wrote one-deleted it.\n\nThey feel like fad diets you‚Äôre committed to for 30 days and then you‚Äôre just like, ‚Äúwhy am I drinking celery juice every morning? I hate celery juice.‚Äù BTW - if you‚Äôve already given up your celery juice cleanse, or had a glass of wine, or eaten bread, or skipped your workout like you SWORE you wouldn‚Äôt... no fret, you‚Äôve come to the right place.\n\nHere‚Äôs something radical I‚Äôm going to try in 2020 that you might want to try, too...\nnot setting any resolutions (gasp!) and forgiving yourself for the ones you did make, but couldn‚Äôt keep... because unrealistic goals are tough.\n\nInstead, try holding space for yourself. Take classes, make art, stretch your muscles and your mind. Spend a day on the couch or hike a mountain. Finish a project or start a new one. Eat a salad or eat a cheeseburger. Skinny dip in an alpine lake or wear cozies all day long.\n\nDo whatever makes you, more YOU. There is no timeline for becoming you. And if it doesn‚Äôt happen in 2020, who cares. each day is a new day.\n\nPhoto by @dylan.h.brown\n\n#selflovejourney #mentalhealthawareness #growthmindset #bereal #authenticity #newyearsresolutions #womenwhohike #ihaveembraced #womenwhohikecolorado #sawtoothmountains #goatlake #optoutside #sheadventures #normalizenormalbodies #idahome",

          "comment": "Instagram vs Reality - let‚Äôs have some real talk on vulnerability and mental health üíõ On my best days I feel grounded, confident, joy filled, strong, capable and totally in love with my life, the world around me and humanity at large. But I have come to understand that being human means experiencing the full spectrum of human emotions. Feeling sad, lonely, anxious, defeated, scared, angry... these feelings are not only valid but critical in order to process and evolve.\n\nSo on my quest to live a more authentic, honest life I‚Äôm challenging myself to be vulnerable to you all today in hopes that it may inspire you to be a little more vulnerable and honest to yourself and your community.\n\nIT‚ÄôS OKAY TO FEEL ALL YOUR FEELINGS.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre going through these moments of feeling challenging emotions the best things that you can do is to allow yourself the time and space to process and TRULY feel these feelings. My personal favorite ways to process my emotions are by talking openly and honestly to a friend, crying alone in my car as hard as I can and for as long as I need, journaling my feelings, seeing a therapist, meditating and spending time in nature.\n\nYou guys know I‚Äôm a huge proponent of rooting in positivity but I think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that no one is happy and positive all the time. And if I‚Äôve learned anything over the years it‚Äôs the importance of making time and space to feel your feelings, even if it‚Äôs momentarily painful. Because our feelings need to be acknowledged and expressed in order to be released. When we swallow or ignore our feelings they will find a way to surface, whether that‚Äôs through illness, depression, emotional outbursts... The better we can become at acknowledging our feelings and expressing them in a healthy way that allows us to process and move on, the better our mental health will become.\n\nSo please just know, it‚Äôs okay to not be okay, it‚Äôs okay to cry, it‚Äôs okay to feel ALL the feelings. It‚Äôs all part of the beautiful journey of being human. I love you and I care about you and I hope my ugly cry face inspires you to have a good cry today or any day you need it üíï",

          "comment": "Officially four weeks out of shoulder surgery!! I can‚Äôt even explain to you guys how amazing it feels to be able to walk outside and breathe fresh air! This was my third shoulder operation in three years and let me tell you it has not been an easy journey, but somehow I‚Äôve managed to stay (mostly) sane! Over the last month I‚Äôve repeated to myself over and over again - ‚ÄúI am strong. I am capable of overcoming great challenges. The universe gives me exactly what I need and what I can handle. I have so much to be grateful for. I will get through this.‚Äù I won‚Äôt pretend there weren‚Äôt dark and painful moments over the last few weeks but I am truly astounded by the power of positivity and gratitude. Rooting in a positive mindset has allowed me to bring humor to the most frustrating moments, to see the blessings in my challenges and to cherish the small victories like buttoning my pants, brushing my hair or short walks in nature, breathing fresh air.\n\nDo you use a mantra or positive affirmation when you‚Äôre going through it? What about a gratitude practice? What are you thankful for in your life right now?\n\nThank you to @googlepixel for encouraging and sponsoring me to capture and share my positive mind set through this recovery process. \n#googlepixel #pixel4 #positivemindset #attitudeofgratitude #sponsored",

          "comment": "2019 - 2018 - 2017 - what a blessing each one of these experiences has been.\n\nIn 2017 I had my first shoulder surgery after a dozen dislocations over 6 years. My mantra to myself at that time went something like ‚Äúafter I get through this everything is going to be better‚Äù\n\nThat shoulder never really healed properly and 11 months later I blew the other one out when I slipped running sprints barefoot in the grass. So in 2018 my mantra went something like ‚Äúno more bad things. Only good things from here on out‚Äù\n\nAnd then in 2019 I got hit by a car skateboarding and blew it out again, I barely had a chance to realize what had just happened before the most powerful voice came in to my head and said ‚Äúyou are so lucky to be alive. You are strong. You are capable of overcoming great challenges and the universe gives you exactly what you need and only what you can handle‚Äù\n\nAs I look forward to 2020 there‚Äôs certainly a piece of me that wants to ask the universe for ‚Äúno more bad things‚Äù but that would really be a waste of a wish. Who‚Äôs to say these injuries were ‚Äúbad‚Äù? And who am I to try and control life? Instead I‚Äôll say that I am incredible blessed to have been tried, tested and to have had the opportunity for incredible growth during these times.\n\nBecause of these experiences I am more patient, more empathetic, more in tune with my body, more supported by my loved ones, more capable of vulnerability and more grateful for the simple joys in life.\n\nSo 2020, I surrender. Whatever it is that you bring forth I will do my best to fully embrace it. It‚Äôs all a part of the journey and I now know my strength. üôèüèº‚ô•Ô∏è",

          "comment": "Instagram vs Reality - let‚Äôs have some real talk on vulnerability and mental health üíõ On my best days I feel grounded, confident, joy filled, strong, capable and totally in love with my life, the world around me and humanity at large. But I have come to understand that being human means experiencing the full spectrum of human emotions. Feeling sad, lonely, anxious, defeated, scared, angry... these feelings are not only valid but critical in order to process and evolve.\n\nSo on my quest to live a more authentic, honest life I‚Äôm challenging myself to be vulnerable to you all today in hopes that it may inspire you to be a little more vulnerable and honest to yourself and your community.\n\nIT‚ÄôS OKAY TO FEEL ALL YOUR FEELINGS.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre going through these moments of feeling challenging emotions the best things that you can do is to allow yourself the time and space to process and TRULY feel these feelings. My personal favorite ways to process my emotions are by talking openly and honestly to a friend, crying alone in my car as hard as I can and for as long as I need, journaling my feelings, seeing a therapist, meditating and spending time in nature.\n\nYou guys know I‚Äôm a huge proponent of rooting in positivity but I think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that no one is happy and positive all the time. And if I‚Äôve learned anything over the years it‚Äôs the importance of making time and space to feel your feelings, even if it‚Äôs momentarily painful. Because our feelings need to be acknowledged and expressed in order to be released. When we swallow or ignore our feelings they will find a way to surface, whether that‚Äôs through illness, depression, emotional outbursts... The better we can become at acknowledging our feelings and expressing them in a healthy way that allows us to process and move on, the better our mental health will become.\n\nSo please just know, it‚Äôs okay to not be okay, it‚Äôs okay to cry, it‚Äôs okay to feel ALL the feelings. It‚Äôs all part of the beautiful journey of being human. I love you and I care about you and I hope my ugly cry face inspires you to have a good cry today or any day you need it üíï",

          "comment": "Officially four weeks out of shoulder surgery!! I can‚Äôt even explain to you guys how amazing it feels to be able to walk outside and breathe fresh air! This was my third shoulder operation in three years and let me tell you it has not been an easy journey, but somehow I‚Äôve managed to stay (mostly) sane! Over the last month I‚Äôve repeated to myself over and over again - ‚ÄúI am strong. I am capable of overcoming great challenges. The universe gives me exactly what I need and what I can handle. I have so much to be grateful for. I will get through this.‚Äù I won‚Äôt pretend there weren‚Äôt dark and painful moments over the last few weeks but I am truly astounded by the power of positivity and gratitude. Rooting in a positive mindset has allowed me to bring humor to the most frustrating moments, to see the blessings in my challenges and to cherish the small victories like buttoning my pants, brushing my hair or short walks in nature, breathing fresh air.\n\nDo you use a mantra or positive affirmation when you‚Äôre going through it? What about a gratitude practice? What are you thankful for in your life right now?\n\nThank you to @googlepixel for encouraging and sponsoring me to capture and share my positive mind set through this recovery process. \n#googlepixel #pixel4 #positivemindset #attitudeofgratitude #sponsored",

          "comment": "2019 - 2018 - 2017 - what a blessing each one of these experiences has been.\n\nIn 2017 I had my first shoulder surgery after a dozen dislocations over 6 years. My mantra to myself at that time went something like ‚Äúafter I get through this everything is going to be better‚Äù\n\nThat shoulder never really healed properly and 11 months later I blew the other one out when I slipped running sprints barefoot in the grass. So in 2018 my mantra went something like ‚Äúno more bad things. Only good things from here on out‚Äù\n\nAnd then in 2019 I got hit by a car skateboarding and blew it out again, I barely had a chance to realize what had just happened before the most powerful voice came in to my head and said ‚Äúyou are so lucky to be alive. You are strong. You are capable of overcoming great challenges and the universe gives you exactly what you need and only what you can handle‚Äù\n\nAs I look forward to 2020 there‚Äôs certainly a piece of me that wants to ask the universe for ‚Äúno more bad things‚Äù but that would really be a waste of a wish. Who‚Äôs to say these injuries were ‚Äúbad‚Äù? And who am I to try and control life? Instead I‚Äôll say that I am incredible blessed to have been tried, tested and to have had the opportunity for incredible growth during these times.\n\nBecause of these experiences I am more patient, more empathetic, more in tune with my body, more supported by my loved ones, more capable of vulnerability and more grateful for the simple joys in life.\n\nSo 2020, I surrender. Whatever it is that you bring forth I will do my best to fully embrace it. It‚Äôs all a part of the journey and I now know my strength. üôèüèº‚ô•Ô∏è",

          "comment": "Perspective.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nThe sun went down after a long day of hiking on my first night in the Dolomites earlier this year and I found myself sitting in the closed dining room of my rifugio. Across he lobby, a group of mountain bikers filled the bar - cheersing beers, singing and dancing well into the early hours of the morning. But I sat alone, a table filled with maps of the Fanes-Sennes-Prags nature park graciously lent to me by the family that ran this particular alpine hut. I traced my fingers along lines on the maps to its highest peaks, jotting down distances and elevations and approximate times - working backward to figure out at what ungodly hour I would need to wake up to be where I wanted to be when the sun poked over the mountain tops. As I unfolded one of the creases I saw a familiar name ‚ÄúLago di Braies, Pragser Wildsee‚Äù I realized that we happened to only be a few kilometres from one of the internet‚Äôs favourite alpine lakes. A summit nearby was circled on one of the more well loved of maps and, without any cell phone service or wifi to verify, I made my way across the lobby into the bar, map in hand, navigating my way through a sea of Italian cyclists and inquired with the elderly man keeping bar. The bar was loud and our language barrier was apparent but I felt confident that he agreed with my hypothesis. And so, a little bit of research, a little bit of luck and a few too few hours of sleep later I was able to find a new perspective on an old favourite. #autumnInsouthtyrol #suedtirol #dolomites",

This could also very well be named a list of products that I recommend to every close friend that ventures out in the backcountry, a list of items I would invest in time and time again, a list of things I wish I had five years ago when I first started backpacking or maybe even a list of items that I would sell a non-vital organ to have with me in the wilderness. These are the things that I count on every single trip to keep me warm and safe and comfortable. And as a bonus, so many of the companies making these products that I love so dearly also happen to be pioneers in sustainability and caring for our planet. So if you‚Äôre (like me, last minute) looking for something that your wilder half will not only love but will last for far longer than it should but also is made by people who care about our planet‚Ä¶ have a look at my holiday gift guide story highlight!",

My mom and I decided to go on a girls trip and after Paris and NYC and Vegas and the entire state of Hawaii were all veto‚Äôd we settled on San Francisco. I na√Øvely thought that, coming from Canada, February would be no different than July and we would be basking in California sunshine for a week. Ah, a time before the weather network was my home page. It rained, some of the coldest and more unrelenting rain I have ever experienced, for the entirety of our trip. We ran a cold, wet, muddy trail race, took a boat to Alcatraz, walked down Lombardo street, took photos at the Golden Gate bridge‚Ä¶. ate our bodyweight in sourdough - you know, the normal SF things. Looking back I don‚Äôt know how I loved that trip so much. Over the years I have come back more times than I am willing to count - an extended layover here and there, a marathon (maybe two), a weekend with old friend I hadn‚Äôt seen in too long‚Ä¶ any excuse I could find.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nThere was a time in my life that I thought I wanted to live here. I could see myself running up and down these steep streets, becoming a regular in a coffee shop - I don‚Äôt think it ever really mattered what I did as long as I was here. Over the past month I‚Äôve spent more time in this city than in Calgary and in all honesty it is exactly what I imagined it would be. Coming here felt a little bit like home - @kelsealoha even came for a visit! But as my time here comes to a close I look back with almost a sense of nostalgia. San Francisco I love you - but its just about time for this little Canadian to head north.",

          "comment": "The first time I visited this perch was just shy of three years ago. It was pouring rain and almost sunset and a group of friends and I huddled under an overhang of the nearby rifugio. The rain let up and we sprinted to the mountains with an almost child-like glee. Fast forward a year later and on a girls trip wherein we took too many coffee breaks on our way from visiting my family in the Austrian Alps and, once again, found ourselves sprinting out to the mountains as the light all too quickly disappeared. We took a few photos, made some silly jokes and retreated to the car where we sat in a parking lot under a sky filled with stars, ate cheese and planned for our week in the alps. On a last minute trip earlier this year with my mom and aunt I was able to sneak in a morning at this spot. I planned and calculated and compulsively checked the weather. I was so excited to share this place that I had grown to love with my family‚Ä¶ they clearly did not share my enthusiasm. The early morning wake up was met with resistance, some snoozing of alarms, a longer than necessary breakfast and some of the slowest driving I have maybe ever seen in my life. The sky lit up every shade of pink and purple as we were still an hour away. I could feel my eyes welling up with tears of frustration and my blood boiling. When we arrived at the parking lot I hastily packed my bag and ran out, a familiar run, to a rang of mountains I love so much. #autumnInsouthtyrol #suedtirol #dolomites\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nI included a little swipe of my three visits. 2017 with @itsbigben, @jesswandering and @michaelmatti. 2018 with @haydenkortemoore and @kelsealoha and 2019 wherein I had the mountain range to myself.",

          "comment": "Depending on other people has never been something I am comfortable with. Earlier this year I wrote a list of things that I rarely do alone, things that I feel better more confident with a friend by my side. Travelling internationally, backcountry wilderness camping and taking photos topped that list. And so, in my mission to independence I decided to tackle the latter two in one foul swoop. I found a camera that I loved (@fujifilm_northamerica X-T30), locked myself in my house for a week watching YouTube tutorials, and then set out on my first solo backpacking trip with the mission to (firstly, not die) but also to take a few photos that I was proud of. I figured that if there was nobody around watching me play around with my camera, getting acquainted¬†with settings and running back and forth between my tripod and whatever perch I was sitting on... I would finally force myself to feel more confident capturing my travels the way I wanted to. And - it worked! Since that trip my camera and tripod hardly leave my side- including this recent trip the Italian Dolomites.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nCheck out the link in my bio for all of the tips and tricks that I have learned (so far) to help you take the perfect adventure self portrait.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nShot on @fujifilm_northamerica X-T30 + 50mm f/2.0 lens | ISO 80, f/2.0, 1/900 sec (#partner)",

          "comment": "We hiked 12.5km, gaining over 1,300 meters of elevation with our heavy packs on to get to this point, the funny thing is that most of the people we shared this sunset dinner view with had driven the (vast) majority of that trek. They came with  everything needed to tightrope walk a kilometer(+) above the canyon floor and tulle filled wedding gowns and bottles of champagne and more than enough food to feed the Canadian military (I didn‚Äôt want to exaggerate). It was unseasonably hot that week and I had packed for the dead of winter - my feet were sore and face was dirty and I knew I probably didn‚Äôt have enough water for the 5(ish)km left of hiking before we reached running water and our campsite for the night. But this dinner was perfect. A few dozen people bursting at the seams with love - newlyweds, newly engaged couples, people celebrating a decade of marriage‚Ä¶ friends celebrating a love for a sport that scares the sh*t out of me. It was a pretty special space to share and a dehydrated dinner I won‚Äôt soon forget.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nI know that this caption ‚Äòshould have‚Äô probably been something about the New Year, the New Decade, resolutions and the holidays - time with friends and family - disconnecting to reconnect. But that has never been my reality for this time of year. Historically I have been sick over the holidays more than I have been healthy and this year was no exception. My entrance into the new decade was more akin to a fumble on the edge of a cliff edge than the graceful debut into 2020 that I envisioned. And if this rings true to you - you‚Äôre not alone. Its okay to have a rough start, its okay to feel defeated and to be not quite okay right now. January 1 is an arbitrary date on the calendar and, as I say most years around this time, maybe one day in the middle of June or October or the last day of March you will take your big life plan, light it on fire and walk blindly down a new path - nobody can tell you that it has to be today.",

My mom and I decided to go on a girls trip and after Paris and NYC and Vegas and the entire state of Hawaii were all veto‚Äôd we settled on San Francisco. I na√Øvely thought that, coming from Canada, February would be no different than July and we would be basking in California sunshine for a week. Ah, a time before the weather network was my home page. It rained, some of the coldest and more unrelenting rain I have ever experienced, for the entirety of our trip. We ran a cold, wet, muddy trail race, took a boat to Alcatraz, walked down Lombardo street, took photos at the Golden Gate bridge‚Ä¶. ate our bodyweight in sourdough - you know, the normal SF things. Looking back I don‚Äôt know how I loved that trip so much. Over the years I have come back more times than I am willing to count - an extended layover here and there, a marathon (maybe two), a weekend with old friend I hadn‚Äôt seen in too long‚Ä¶ any excuse I could find.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nThere was a time in my life that I thought I wanted to live here. I could see myself running up and down these steep streets, becoming a regular in a coffee shop - I don‚Äôt think it ever really mattered what I did as long as I was here. Over the past month I‚Äôve spent more time in this city than in Calgary and in all honesty it is exactly what I imagined it would be. Coming here felt a little bit like home - @kelsealoha even came for a visit! But as my time here comes to a close I look back with almost a sense of nostalgia. San Francisco I love you - but its just about time for this little Canadian to head north.",

This could also very well be named a list of products that I recommend to every close friend that ventures out in the backcountry, a list of items I would invest in time and time again, a list of things I wish I had five years ago when I first started backpacking or maybe even a list of items that I would sell a non-vital organ to have with me in the wilderness. These are the things that I count on every single trip to keep me warm and safe and comfortable. And as a bonus, so many of the companies making these products that I love so dearly also happen to be pioneers in sustainability and caring for our planet. So if you‚Äôre (like me, last minute) looking for something that your wilder half will not only love but will last for far longer than it should but also is made by people who care about our planet‚Ä¶ have a look at my holiday gift guide story highlight!",

          "comment": "The first time I visited this perch was just shy of three years ago. It was pouring rain and almost sunset and a group of friends and I huddled under an overhang of the nearby rifugio. The rain let up and we sprinted to the mountains with an almost child-like glee. Fast forward a year later and on a girls trip wherein we took too many coffee breaks on our way from visiting my family in the Austrian Alps and, once again, found ourselves sprinting out to the mountains as the light all too quickly disappeared. We took a few photos, made some silly jokes and retreated to the car where we sat in a parking lot under a sky filled with stars, ate cheese and planned for our week in the alps. On a last minute trip earlier this year with my mom and aunt I was able to sneak in a morning at this spot. I planned and calculated and compulsively checked the weather. I was so excited to share this place that I had grown to love with my family‚Ä¶ they clearly did not share my enthusiasm. The early morning wake up was met with resistance, some snoozing of alarms, a longer than necessary breakfast and some of the slowest driving I have maybe ever seen in my life. The sky lit up every shade of pink and purple as we were still an hour away. I could feel my eyes welling up with tears of frustration and my blood boiling. When we arrived at the parking lot I hastily packed my bag and ran out, a familiar run, to a rang of mountains I love so much. #autumnInsouthtyrol #suedtirol #dolomites\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nI included a little swipe of my three visits. 2017 with @itsbigben, @jesswandering and @michaelmatti. 2018 with @haydenkortemoore and @kelsealoha and 2019 wherein I had the mountain range to myself.",

          "comment": "Perspective.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nThe sun went down after a long day of hiking on my first night in the Dolomites earlier this year and I found myself sitting in the closed dining room of my rifugio. Across he lobby, a group of mountain bikers filled the bar - cheersing beers, singing and dancing well into the early hours of the morning. But I sat alone, a table filled with maps of the Fanes-Sennes-Prags nature park graciously lent to me by the family that ran this particular alpine hut. I traced my fingers along lines on the maps to its highest peaks, jotting down distances and elevations and approximate times - working backward to figure out at what ungodly hour I would need to wake up to be where I wanted to be when the sun poked over the mountain tops. As I unfolded one of the creases I saw a familiar name ‚ÄúLago di Braies, Pragser Wildsee‚Äù I realized that we happened to only be a few kilometres from one of the internet‚Äôs favourite alpine lakes. A summit nearby was circled on one of the more well loved of maps and, without any cell phone service or wifi to verify, I made my way across the lobby into the bar, map in hand, navigating my way through a sea of Italian cyclists and inquired with the elderly man keeping bar. The bar was loud and our language barrier was apparent but I felt confident that he agreed with my hypothesis. And so, a little bit of research, a little bit of luck and a few too few hours of sleep later I was able to find a new perspective on an old favourite. #autumnInsouthtyrol #suedtirol #dolomites",

          "comment": "Depending on other people has never been something I am comfortable with. Earlier this year I wrote a list of things that I rarely do alone, things that I feel better more confident with a friend by my side. Travelling internationally, backcountry wilderness camping and taking photos topped that list. And so, in my mission to independence I decided to tackle the latter two in one foul swoop. I found a camera that I loved (@fujifilm_northamerica X-T30), locked myself in my house for a week watching YouTube tutorials, and then set out on my first solo backpacking trip with the mission to (firstly, not die) but also to take a few photos that I was proud of. I figured that if there was nobody around watching me play around with my camera, getting acquainted¬†with settings and running back and forth between my tripod and whatever perch I was sitting on... I would finally force myself to feel more confident capturing my travels the way I wanted to. And - it worked! Since that trip my camera and tripod hardly leave my side- including this recent trip the Italian Dolomites.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nCheck out the link in my bio for all of the tips and tricks that I have learned (so far) to help you take the perfect adventure self portrait.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nShot on @fujifilm_northamerica X-T30 + 50mm f/2.0 lens | ISO 80, f/2.0, 1/900 sec (#partner)",

They came with  everything needed to tightrope walk a kilometer(+) above the canyon floor and tulle filled wedding gowns and bottles of champagne and more than enough food to feed the Canadian military (I didn‚Äôt want to exaggerate). It was unseasonably hot that week and I had packed for the dead of winter - my feet were sore and face was dirty and I knew I probably didn‚Äôt have enough water for the 5(ish)km left of hiking before we reached running water and our campsite for the night. But this dinner was perfect. A few dozen people bursting at the seams with love - newlyweds, newly engaged couples, people celebrating a decade of marriage‚Ä¶ friends celebrating a love for a sport that scares the sh*t out of me. It was a pretty special space to share and a dehydrated dinner I won‚Äôt soon forget.\n‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä\nI know that this caption ‚Äòshould have‚Äô probably been something about the New Year, the New Decade, resolutions and the holidays - time with friends and family - disconnecting to reconnect. But that has never been my reality for this time of year. Historically I have been sick over the holidays more than I have been healthy and this year was no exception. My entrance into the new decade was more akin to a fumble on the edge of a cliff edge than the graceful debut into 2020 that I envisioned. And if this rings true to you - you‚Äôre not alone. Its okay to have a rough start, its okay to feel defeated and to be not quite okay right now. January 1 is an arbitrary date on the calendar and, as I say most years around this time, maybe one day in the middle of June or October or the last day of March you will take your big life plan, light it on fire and walk blindly down a new path - nobody can tell you that it has to be today.",

          "comment": "While fires continue to ravage communities in Australia here are some current statistics to mull over:\n6,300,000 hectares or 16,000,000 acres have been burnt. 24 people have been killed and another 6 missing. Half a billion animals have been killed. 2500 buildings have been destroyed with 1300 of those being homes. At least 200 fires are still burning all over Australia - many out of control. \nThese statistics are obviously heartbreaking and it is easy to feel incredibly helpless, but it is also evident that the people on the front line are in need of as much help as possible. I know $5, $10, $20 feels like it wouldn‚Äôt do anything, but collectively it can rebuild lives, homes and communities. For organisations to donate to I have a list on my website (follow the link in my bio) and within my stories. I have also opened a print store on my website where 100% of the proceeds will go directly to the bushfire appeal. So please, if you are in the position to donate a few dollars, or have been wanting a print of mine, now is the time to act.\nMy heart goes out to all of those affected by these fires, everyone on the front line, all of the volunteers & aid workers, and hope rain reaches you soon!\nP.S this is not a current bushfire image from Australia",

I remembered seeing patches on the side of the road as a child during family road trips to Central Otago, but we never stopped. They‚Äôre just a weed my parents would tell me, which I now know to be true. As pretty as they are and as amazing as they smell, they were introduced to New Zealand and are actually harmful to some native plants and bird life whose habitats they have overrun. With that said, they are still a photographers dream, and with active attempts to control them, they may one day soon be gone. \nHere‚Äôs @joellefriend frolicking amongst this beautiful weed, staying warm on a chilly New Zealand spring evening wearing the @eddiebauer ladder creek high-pile parka! We couldn‚Äôt believe how many different colors there were! Swipe to check them all out! üå∏#LiveYourAdventure #EBContributor\n\n@eddiebauer also happens to have an amazing Parka sale going on right now for anyone who wants to snag one! Link in my bio :)",

          "comment": "Although I‚Äôve definitely grown to love winter more over the past few years, I still find myself occasionally falling back into a love/hate kind of relationship with the cold. After returning from New Zealand just a couple of days ago I‚Äôve found myself wanting to hibernate for a bit. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs partially due to jet lag but it‚Äôs also hard to adjust back to Alberta temps after some beautiful summer days down under. But again I just needed to remind myself that winter really is what you make of it. Embrace it and get out in it and find activities you love and you will quickly find yourself enjoying those colder days. With only a few more days until it‚Äôs officially winter here in the Rockies I thought it was timely to remind myself to embrace my first winter up North! And it definitely doesn‚Äôt hurt that I have a package from @eddiebauer on the way with some new ski gear and other cozy winter stuff that I can‚Äôt wait to share with you guys! #LiveYourAdventure #EBContributor\n\n@eddiebauer also has 50% off on their website & in stores right now!

          "comment": "Just a few of the many highlights of 2019! It‚Äôs been a wild year full of some big challenges, and a lot of change. I left the U.S after making my home there for the best part of 9 years and made the move North to Canada. Leaving Montana wasn‚Äôt easy by a long stretch but the promise of new adventures, along with my inability to ever stay in one place, meant it was time for a new challenge. Only a few months after moving I broke my ankle while on a backcountry trip in Colorado, a bit of a set back for someone who lives for adventure. I was unable to fully work for weeks and forced to cancel several trips I had been really excited for. On the plus side, I had more visitors than ever before, both old friends and new, who took me on broken ankle friendly adventures; and I was able to spend a ton of time planning for future trips, and also watching way too much Netflix üòÖ It helped me to truly appreciate the little things in life and the people who are always there when you need them. I also met a bunch of new people this year, many of whom I now consider friends, and went on some of my favorite trips yet! Anyway thanks so much to everyone who‚Äôs been a part of my journey this year, it means the world to me! And here‚Äôs to another incredible year in 2020! Happy New Year! ‚ú®",

          "comment": "Although I‚Äôve definitely grown to love winter more over the past few years, I still find myself occasionally falling back into a love/hate kind of relationship with the cold. After returning from New Zealand just a couple of days ago I‚Äôve found myself wanting to hibernate for a bit. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs partially due to jet lag but it‚Äôs also hard to adjust back to Alberta temps after some beautiful summer days down under. But again I just needed to remind myself that winter really is what you make of it. Embrace it and get out in it and find activities you love and you will quickly find yourself enjoying those colder days. With only a few more days until it‚Äôs officially winter here in the Rockies I thought it was timely to remind myself to embrace my first winter up North! And it definitely doesn‚Äôt hurt that I have a package from @eddiebauer on the way with some new ski gear and other cozy winter stuff that I can‚Äôt wait to share with you guys! #LiveYourAdventure #EBContributor\n\n@eddiebauer also has 50% off on their website & in stores right now!

I remembered seeing patches on the side of the road as a child during family road trips to Central Otago, but we never stopped. They‚Äôre just a weed my parents would tell me, which I now know to be true. As pretty as they are and as amazing as they smell, they were introduced to New Zealand and are actually harmful to some native plants and bird life whose habitats they have overrun. With that said, they are still a photographers dream, and with active attempts to control them, they may one day soon be gone. \nHere‚Äôs @joellefriend frolicking amongst this beautiful weed, staying warm on a chilly New Zealand spring evening wearing the @eddiebauer ladder creek high-pile parka! We couldn‚Äôt believe how many different colors there were!

          "comment": "Just a few of the many highlights of 2019! It‚Äôs been a wild year full of some big challenges, and a lot of change. I left the U.S after making my home there for the best part of 9 years and made the move North to Canada. Leaving Montana wasn‚Äôt easy by a long stretch but the promise of new adventures, along with my inability to ever stay in one place, meant it was time for a new challenge. Only a few months after moving I broke my ankle while on a backcountry trip in Colorado, a bit of a set back for someone who lives for adventure. I was unable to fully work for weeks and forced to cancel several trips I had been really excited for. On the plus side, I had more visitors than ever before, both old friends and new, who took me on broken ankle friendly adventures; and I was able to spend a ton of time planning for future trips, and also watching way too much Netflix üòÖ It helped me to truly appreciate the little things in life and the people who are always there when you need them. I also met a bunch of new people this year, many of whom I now consider friends, and went on some of my favorite trips yet! Anyway thanks so much to everyone who‚Äôs been a part of my journey this year, it means the world to me! And here‚Äôs to another incredible year in 2020! Happy New Year! ‚ú®",

          "comment": "The art of sitting still.\n.\n.\nMeditation.\n\nDaily life and stress and worries tend to get overwhelming at times. Seems like my brain never wants to shut off. I need creative outlets to focus on. I think that's why I love climbing so much. When I'm climbing it takes 100% concentration on the present moment. There is no time for your mind to wander. But it is extremely stressful sometimes.\n\nNormally, mental and physical stress cause increased levels of the stress hormone¬†cortisol. This produces many of the harmful effects of stress, such as the release of inflammation-promoting chemicals called cytokines. Which can wreak havoc on your adrenals, effect your thyroid, which can create all sorts of problems like depression, lack of sleep, attention span, memory, mental health and the general ability to cope with shit.\n\nFrequently, when I'm out climbing and I get stressed out, I'll take time for myself, walk away and sit quietly and just breathe. By simply sitting up tall and focusing on the breath,\nmaybe even forcing a smile,\nyou can control your mood, anxiety and stress levels.\n\nMindfulness meditation is simple... Find a place to sit comfortably, somewhere quiet and free of distractions. Breathe in and out focusing on the breath. When thoughts pop up, and they definitely will, acknowledge them and let them go. When your mind wanders just bring it back to the breath.\nThat's it.\n\nStart small with 10 min a day, then work your way up to 30, and then an hour. The benifits of doing this are huge and you will notice a shift immediately. Don't worry about if you are doing it correctly.\nJust sit still and breathe...\n.\nPC: @eric_fallecker",

          "comment": "Well another injury...Recovering pretty well from the left shoulder pain I decided to start a 7a- 5.11d as my next project. A pretty aggressive left 2 finger pocket to a powerful right hand throw, popping off tweaked my ring finger in a way that shot pain down my forearm. Still climbed the rest of the route to the crux and immediately felt it start to swell.\nI spent the rest of the day resting and icing it. Today it feels only sore in the muscle so thankfully I think it will be ok in a few days. I'm taking a few days rest and then hopefully I'll be back to project.\nThankfully there is plenty of activities around camp to keep your mind and body occupied. I have been doing hours of meditation and spending time in this beautiful nature that surrounds me. I even cut my own hair today! \nSlacklining is something I have always wanted to learn, so now I get to. My left arm is pretty bruised and sore but with one more week here I'm positive I'll be able to hop back on the in no time.\n.\n.\n.\nPC: @kimmie.tu \n#climbgirls #teamevolv #adidasterrex #goatworthy #climbing #liveyouradventure #livemorehappy #girlsthatclimb #stronger #goodvibes #slackline #healing #climberslife #climbingismypassion",

          "comment": "On the day before I left I decided to give this climb a go. The previous week I went way too hard and was feeling quite a bit of pain in my left shoulder and forearm so I had been taking it sort of easy on pushing grades and climbing fairly mellow. I wanted to spend my last day giving it all I had left. This one was highly recommended so I went for it.\nFirst go I took a nasty whipper sending me crashing into the tufa with my right forearm. Too up in my head and lots of noise, screaming babies and chaos down below I decided to come back in the evening.\nWe came back and I worked it a few more times only being able to get past the crux once, but still not feeling super confident about the beta. My skin and body was screaming enough. As the sun went down I decided to come back in the morning to retrieve my draws and try again.\nWith the help of a few amazing friends, @kimmie.tu, Will, Stephan and Tristen, we got out there at 6am and I got to work. Falling multiple times again in the crux I was almost ready to give up. My fingers were raw and blistered, body and shoulder aching I was ready to except this wasn't going to go for me right now. Kimmie wouldn't allow it.\nYou got this girl.\nShe worked through the beta with me and unlocked a new sequence. I knew I probably only had enough power and skin left to try one last time so I gave it everything I had. I sent it right as the sun was hitting the rock at 9:30am. It was the best feeling ending this trip on such a high. I cleaned my draws and ran back to camp just in time to catch my taxi out of Thakhek. Feeling so grateful. Thanks for not letting me give up Kimmie!\n.\n.\n\"Mon General\" 6c 5.11a/b\nPC: @kimmie.tu \n@evolv_worldwide @adidasterrex #teamevolv #adidasterrex #createdwithadidas #evolv #oracles #mountaingirls #climbinglife #livemorehappy #sendit #liveyouradventure #rockclimbingwomen #lovethelifeyoulive #climbing_lovers",

          "comment": "I've been hanging out here in the jungle for 16 days now. I'm coming to the end of my journey and traveling on. It was a nice break from the world. I haven't been able to use my phone or have service out here, only the occasional hotspot from friends and a couple trips to town on rest days. But even then it was brief. I gotta say I didn't realize how connected I was. Having a world of information in the palm of your hand, access to anything at anytime, being able to scroll mindlessly out of boredom or see what your friends are up to. It was a little strange at first and weirdly found myself getting into my head a lot. Having crazy dreams and restlessness, almost like anxiety and loneliness.\nI got injured and wasn't able to climb, so I was forced to rest and I had lots of time to myself. I started to use the time to meditate. To sit in my bungalow in the jungle for hours and listen to the wind and my breath. It was not easy and it took me a few days to really get used to it, but when I did it was magical. I started doing breathing exercises and focusing my energy on my body and healing.\nBefore I would wake up and reach for my phone and start to rush through my day. Out here I wake up with the sunrise, or before, and start to meditate and greet the day with new eyes and be completely present. It's such a simple thing to be fully present yet to most of us it's the hardest thing in the world.\nI allowed myself to be fully present here. To feel all the feelings and connect with the amazing people around me. I worked through the pain in my body and was able to climb most days. Even though I didn't get to crush as many climbs as I wanted to on this trip I definitely grew in so many other ways. I pushed myself harder physically and mentally than ever and I am truly grateful for this experience. I'm grateful for the incredible people I met here and the moments I'll remember forever.\n.\n.\nThanks for the photo @jojoyees and everything. I hope to see you again soon.

          "comment": "Just getting back to LA after traveling around for a month. It feels really good to be back home, body exhausted with my heart full of gratitude.\nThis past weekend was such a nice way to end a long climbing trip, hiking and hanging out with a rad crew of ladies. I needed a break from the climbing, and what better place to enjoy other outdoor activities than this place?! It's so beautiful in Utah, I should just move here already.\nMy shoulder has been in quite a bit of pain. I think I will have to chill on the climbing for a week or two so I can give my body some time to heal.\nAny recommendations on what I should do with my shoulder while I'm resting to make it better is appreciated! Right now it hurts to do almost anything strenuous with it. Send me beta stat! üò´\n.\nPC: @megkkee\n@greaterzionutah #gzpartner2019 @mountaingirls #mountaingirls #liveyouradventure #livemorehappy #girlsthatclimb #exploreeverything #travel #stgeorgeutah #utah",

          "comment": "Well another injury...Recovering pretty well from the left shoulder pain I decided to start a 7a- 5.11d as my next project. A pretty aggressive left 2 finger pocket to a powerful right hand throw, popping off tweaked my ring finger in a way that shot pain down my forearm. Still climbed the rest of the route to the crux and immediately felt it start to swell.\nI spent the rest of the day resting and icing it. Today it feels only sore in the muscle so thankfully I think it will be ok in a few days. I'm taking a few days rest and then hopefully I'll be back to project.\nThankfully there is plenty of activities around camp to keep your mind and body occupied. I have been doing hours of meditation and spending time in this beautiful nature that surrounds me. I even cut my own hair today! \nSlacklining is something I have always wanted to learn, so now I get to. My left arm is pretty bruised and sore but with one more week here I'm positive I'll be able to hop back on the in no time.\n.\n.\n.\nPC: @kimmie.tu \n#climbgirls #teamevolv #adidasterrex #goatworthy #climbing #liveyouradventure #livemorehappy #girlsthatclimb #stronger #goodvibes #slackline #healing #climberslife #climbingismypassion",

          "comment": "I've been hanging out here in the jungle for 16 days now. I'm coming to the end of my journey and traveling on. It was a nice break from the world. I haven't been able to use my phone or have service out here, only the occasional hotspot from friends and a couple trips to town on rest days. But even then it was brief. I gotta say I didn't realize how connected I was. Having a world of information in the palm of your hand, access to anything at anytime, being able to scroll mindlessly out of boredom or see what your friends are up to. It was a little strange at first and weirdly found myself getting into my head a lot. Having crazy dreams and restlessness, almost like anxiety and loneliness.\nI got injured and wasn't able to climb, so I was forced to rest and I had lots of time to myself. I started to use the time to meditate. To sit in my bungalow in the jungle for hours and listen to the wind and my breath. It was not easy and it took me a few days to really get used to it, but when I did it was magical. I started doing breathing exercises and focusing my energy on my body and healing.\nBefore I would wake up and reach for my phone and start to rush through my day. Out here I wake up with the sunrise, or before, and start to meditate and greet the day with new eyes and be completely present. It's such a simple thing to be fully present yet to most of us it's the hardest thing in the world.\nI allowed myself to be fully present here. To feel all the feelings and connect with the amazing people around me. I worked through the pain in my body and was able to climb most days. Even though I didn't get to crush as many climbs as I wanted to on this trip I definitely grew in so many other ways. I pushed myself harder physically and mentally than ever and I am truly grateful for this experience. I'm grateful for the incredible people I met here and the moments I'll remember forever.\n.\n.\nThanks for the photo @jojoyees and everything. I hope to see you again soon.

          "comment": "On the day before I left I decided to give this climb a go. The previous week I went way too hard and was feeling quite a bit of pain in my left shoulder and forearm so I had been taking it sort of easy on pushing grades and climbing fairly mellow. I wanted to spend my last day giving it all I had left. This one was highly recommended so I went for it.\nFirst go I took a nasty whipper sending me crashing into the tufa with my right forearm. Too up in my head and lots of noise, screaming babies and chaos down below I decided to come back in the evening.\nWe came back and I worked it a few more times only being able to get past the crux once, but still not feeling super confident about the beta. My skin and body was screaming enough. As the sun went down I decided to come back in the morning to retrieve my draws and try again.\nWith the help of a few amazing friends, @kimmie.tu, Will, Stephan and Tristen, we got out there at 6am and I got to work. Falling multiple times again in the crux I was almost ready to give up. My fingers were raw and blistered, body and shoulder aching I was ready to except this wasn't going to go for me right now. Kimmie wouldn't allow it.\nYou got this girl.\nShe worked through the beta with me and unlocked a new sequence. I knew I probably only had enough power and skin left to try one last time so I gave it everything I had. I sent it right as the sun was hitting the rock at 9:30am. It was the best feeling ending this trip on such a high. I cleaned my draws and ran back to camp just in time to catch my taxi out of Thakhek. Feeling so grateful. Thanks for not letting me give up Kimmie!\n.\n.\n\"Mon General\" 6c 5.11a/b\nPC: @kimmie.tu \n@evolv_worldwide @adidasterrex #teamevolv #adidasterrex #createdwithadidas #evolv #oracles #mountaingirls #climbinglife #livemorehappy #sendit #liveyouradventure #rockclimbingwomen #lovethelifeyoulive #climbing_lovers",

          "comment": "Just getting back to LA after traveling around for a month. It feels really good to be back home, body exhausted with my heart full of gratitude.\nThis past weekend was such a nice way to end a long climbing trip, hiking and hanging out with a rad crew of ladies. I needed a break from the climbing, and what better place to enjoy other outdoor activities than this place?! It's so beautiful in Utah, I should just move here already.\nMy shoulder has been in quite a bit of pain. I think I will have to chill on the climbing for a week or two so I can give my body some time to heal.\nAny recommendations on what I should do with my shoulder while I'm resting to make it better is appreciated! Right now it hurts to do almost anything strenuous with it. Send me beta stat! üò´\n.\nPC: @megkkee\n@greaterzionutah #gzpartner2019 @mountaingirls #mountaingirls #liveyouradventure #livemorehappy #girlsthatclimb #exploreeverything #travel #stgeorgeutah #utah",

          "comment": "The art of sitting still.\n.\n.\nMeditation.\n\nDaily life and stress and worries tend to get overwhelming at times. Seems like my brain never wants to shut off. I need creative outlets to focus on. I think that's why I love climbing so much. When I'm climbing it takes 100% concentration on the present moment. There is no time for your mind to wander. But it is extremely stressful sometimes.\n\nNormally, mental and physical stress cause increased levels of the stress hormone¬†cortisol. This produces many of the harmful effects of stress, such as the release of inflammation-promoting chemicals called cytokines. Which can wreak havoc on your adrenals, effect your thyroid, which can create all sorts of problems like depression, lack of sleep, attention span, memory, mental health and the general ability to cope with shit.\n\nFrequently, when I'm out climbing and I get stressed out, I'll take time for myself, walk away and sit quietly and just breathe. By simply sitting up tall and focusing on the breath,\nmaybe even forcing a smile,\nyou can control your mood, anxiety and stress levels.\n\nMindfulness meditation is simple... Find a place to sit comfortably, somewhere quiet and free of distractions. Breathe in and out focusing on the breath. When thoughts pop up, and they definitely will, acknowledge them and let them go. When your mind wanders just bring it back to the breath.\nThat's it.\n\nStart small with 10 min a day, then work your way up to 30, and then an hour. The benifits of doing this are huge and you will notice a shift immediately. Don't worry about if you are doing it correctly.\nJust sit still and breathe...\n.\nPC: @eric_fallecker",
